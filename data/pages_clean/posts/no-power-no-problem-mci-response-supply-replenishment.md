#### Keep Vaccines Safe for Days

Power outages create major problems with vaccine storage (i.e. South Australia’s $400K loss last year). The ability to protect vaccines during a blackout is not easy since the typical vaccine fridge drifts above 8°C within a couple of hours after losing electricity. Click here to read our blog on the topic or head on over to our Cool Cube™ page to learn how these freeze-safe coolers can be used for both off-site clinics AND as a backup for blackouts. With Cool Cubes™, staff and management can be assured that the cold chain is intact through the night, weekend, or any other multi-day span.

#### Complete Triage & Treatment
The scene is safe, but now providers at a mass casualty incident (MCI) must analyze the number and severity of patients. Next will be basic treatment with the on-scene resources. Wouldn’t this be the ideal time to roll out color-coded cases organized with assets that are ready for such a situation? VeriCor’s Triage and Treatment modules are Response-Friendly®, which means patient treatment is more complete, efficient & simpler than conventional alternatives. Be safe and be prepared with a VeriCor Triage and Treatment System.
