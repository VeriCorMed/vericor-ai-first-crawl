### A) Protecting Temperature-Sensitive Products
#### The Secret Weapon
Ensuring product viability during power outages is a critical concern in the medical field. Standard refrigerators can fail to maintain safe temperatures within hours. Cool Cube™ PCM coolers offer a dependable solution.
These innovative coolers utilize Phase Change Material (PCM) technology to maintain precise temperature ranges for several days, eliminating the need for electricity or external cooling. This ensures temperature-sensitive products’ continued safety and efficacy during storage and transport, even during a power outage.
If you haven’t already, watch this [113-second explainer video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9G9pjNjopU&feature=youtu.be) to see the simplicity and effectiveness of Cool Cube™ PCM Coolers.
