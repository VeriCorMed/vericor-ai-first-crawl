### The Cool Cube™ Story
#### From a Concept to a Product Line
Late 2009 we learned about the need our customer base had for a reliable cooler/pack-out system to transport vaccine with. By the spring of 2010 our first solution (called the “Vaccine Transporter”) was being used by a health department 100 miles north of VeriCor for off-site vaccination clinics. Today, the Cool Cube™ product line consists of four sizes of coolers capable of handling three different temperature configurations (fridge, freezer and controlled room temps).

### The VACCINATOR Line[![Ready-to-Go Supplies](https://www.vericormed.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Ready-to-Go-Supplies-300x200.jpg)](https://www.vericormed.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Ready-to-Go-Supplies.jpg)
#### Supplies Ready to Go
The DIY model of counting, ordering and organizing all of the supplies needed for upcoming vaccination campaigns is tiresome. Save time and look more professional with pre-packaged kits by VeriCor. We have three primary sizes: 500, 2500, & 5000-person. These easy-to-store, simple-to-move, “just add staff and vaccine” kits can be used for seasonal off-site clinics or stored for large-scale pandemics. Already have the supplies but like our setup? Get a workstation to fit your needs (various sizes and configurations available). [ Learn More](https://www.vericormed.com/vaccination-systems/)

#### Risk Mitigation
Experts say that pandemic influenza outbreaks typically strike 3-4 times a century. Although considerable progress has been made in the last few years, scientists continue to warn about the risk of not being prepared. Mitigate the risk with a VeriCor Pan-Flu Cache. This system is ready to respond to an increased demand within a facility and/or at a non-traditional site. The Response-Friendly® approach assures that it has a compact storage footprint, is easily managed, is highly organized and will rapidly setup.
