### A) COVID-19 Myths
#### What’s true and what’s not true.
Sometimes we hear something about COVID-19 and think—huh? Here are some myths of coronavirus:
  * Exposing yourself to the sun or to temperatures higher than 25°C/77°F prevents the coronavirus disease. ([Myth Debunked](https://www.who.int/images/default-source/health-topics/coronavirus/myth-busters/web-mythbusters/mb-sun-exposure.tmb-1920v.jpg?sfvrsn=658ce588_3))
  * The new coronavirus can be transmitted through mosquito bites. ([Myth Debunked](https://www.who.int/images/default-source/health-topics/coronavirus/myth-busters/web-mythbusters/mb-mosquito-bite.png?sfvrsn=a1d90f6_2))
  * Taking a hot bath prevents the new coronavirus disease. ([Myth Debunked](https://www.who.int/images/default-source/health-topics/coronavirus/myth-busters/web-mythbusters/mb-hot-bath.png?sfvrsn=f1ebbc_2))
  * Cold weather and snow kills the new coronavirus. ([Myth Debunked](https://www.who.int/images/default-source/health-topics/coronavirus/myth-busters/web-mythbusters/mb-cold-snow.png?sfvrsn=1e557ba_2))
  * Being able to hold your breath for 10 seconds or more without coughing or feeling discomfort means you are free from the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) or any other lung disease. ([Myth Debunked](https://www.who.int/images/default-source/health-topics/coronavirus/myth-busters/web-mythbusters/mb-breathing-exercice.tmb-1024v.jpg?sfvrsn=db06f4a9_3))

### B) When a Replenishment Might be Needed
#### Re-stocking a preparedness cache can be easy.
That preparedness cache may have been raided (or is currently being raided) for responding to COVID-19. The good news is that if it’s a VeriCor Response-Friendly® System it’s built on a sustainable platform. Let us know the supplies that need to be re-stocked, and we can send you packaged supplies (with location tags) along with a new SmartBook™. If the labor and time would still be too much, we can do a full-service, on-site replenishment. Maybe it hasn’t been touched in a while? Let us do an audit on the system and see what’s expired and give you some options. Call (608) 526-6901 today to speak with a replenishment specialist.
