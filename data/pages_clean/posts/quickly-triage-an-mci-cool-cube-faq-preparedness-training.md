#### A Disaster Planning System

A VeriCor Triage & Treatment System manages and equips responders with the resources to triage AND treat victims of a mass casualty incident (MCI). Color-coded mobile cases and care-specific hanging jump bags that contain the prepackaged supplies are the backbone of the system, while a SmartBook™ enables the simple management of product during and after an event.
