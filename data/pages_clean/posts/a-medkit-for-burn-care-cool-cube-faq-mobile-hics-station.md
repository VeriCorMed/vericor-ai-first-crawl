#### Mass Casualty Burn Treatment
Does your facility have the assets required to respond to a mass burn casualty event? The Response-Friendly® Burn Care MedKit can fill the gaps of your inventory with supplies specialized for burn care treatment. When deployed, the Upright Medical Organizer (MC-UMO) gives medical personnel quick access to supplies in an open, clear-pocket organizer that hangs on an included stand (or any door). When not in use, the UMO gets rolled-up (with supplies) and securely stored, while the exclusive SmartBook™ gives detailed information (lot #s, expiration dates, manufacturers, etc.) for easy management. With ASPR making burn care a priority (p.52 here), these customizable kits are in high demand. Call today with your response, storage and budgetary requirements.

###  Cool Cube™ FAQ[![Temp Holding PCM Panels](https://www.vericormed.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Temp-Holding-PCM-Panels-300x200.jpg)](https://www.vericormed.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Temp-Holding-PCM-Panels.jpg)
####  Another thing to keep in mind…
**Question:** What does “freeze-safe” technology mean?

**Answer:** When vaccines and other refrigerated products are transported, temperatures inside carriers are often maintained with frozen ice packs, putting the vaccines/products at risk of freezing. Many vaccines containing aluminum adjuvants are freeze sensitive and costly. So if frozen, these vaccines lose potency and potentially leave vaccinated individuals at risk of disease. To protect temperature sensitive product from freezing, VeriCor Cool Cube™ coolers use engineered phase change material (PCM) rather than frozen ice packs in the coolers. If ice packs are used, they must be conditioned or allowed to warm from freezer temps to 0°C. But even then, those ice packs will stay at 0°C until the pack is fully melted (below the often mandated 1-2°C that you MUST stay above). On the other hand, PCM panels engineered to melt at 4.5°C will do just that…maintain a 4.5°C temperature until fully melted (well within the guidelines of ALL refrigerated product). Therefore, properly engineered PCM technology can be called “freeze-safe” due to its thermodynamic properties.

Transform Anytime & Anywhere

In preparation for the next logistical, operational or command situation, organize needed supplies within a colorful Hospital Incident Command Station by VeriCor. In storage it takes up the space of a desk. In deployment it facilitates command and control. A built-in laptop stand, overhead light, inlay map/document greaseboard, and two Easyboards® are just a few of the features of this case. Pair it with the [HICS Support Module](https://www.vericormed.com/product/hospital-incident-command-support-module-sm-hics/) (or your own kit) and be ready to respond anytime…anywhere.
