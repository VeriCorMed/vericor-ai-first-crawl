### A) Science Speaks!
#### Evidence-Based Wound Care with Petroleum Jelly
In VeriCor modularized systems, we are switching from an antibiotic ointment to petroleum jelly for wound care applications. Why?
  1. **Antibiotic Resistance:** Overuse of antibiotics contributes to the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. By reducing antibiotic ointments, we can help prevent the spread of these resistant strains.
  2. **Allergic Reactions:** Some people are allergic to the ingredients in antibiotic ointments, which can cause skin irritation and delay healing. Petroleum jelly is less likely to cause allergic reactions in the field.
  3. **Cost-Effectiveness:** Petroleum jelly is generally less expensive than antibiotic ointments, making it a more cost-effective option for preparedness needs.
  4. **Similar Efficacy:** Studies have shown that petroleum jelly is as effective as antibiotic ointments in preventing infection and promoting wound healing for minor wounds.

It’s important to note that this is not a blanket statement. In some cases, our customers may still need antibiotic ointments. However, petroleum jelly will be an alternative to the previously used bacitracin for our general wound care modules.
