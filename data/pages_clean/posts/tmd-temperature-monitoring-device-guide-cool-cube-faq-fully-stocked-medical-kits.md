### A) Cool Cube™ FAQ
`
 `
#### _A Question From Your Colleagues_
`
 `
**Question** : “How does the Cool Cube™ stay cold? Does it need to be plugged in?”
`
 `
**Answer** : A Cool Cube™ is categorized as a “passive” system. Simply put, they do not need an internal power source to work. Instead they rely on phase change material (“PCM” technology) coupled with high-performance vacuum insulation (better than well-known commercial coolers) to maintain needed temperatures. The passive system is as simple, safe, effective and portable as you can get. If you haven’t already, watch [this short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9G9pjNjopU&feature=youtu.be) (also linked to the image above) to see the safety and simplicity of the Cool Cube™.

More advanced than a first aid kit, VeriCor MedKits contain treatment-specific supplies that are organized within a portable, rolled-up, quick-to-deploy UMO (Upright Medical Organizer…an advanced “jump bag”). When in a pinch, the responding providers have exact locations of the supplies (bag # and pocket) to facilitate a more effective response. Choose from a wide range of pre-built MedKits, or let us customize one tailored to your needs.
