# No Insulating Material Needed | Fully Stocked Medical Kits | Pandemic Flu EP Cache

Hello, medical professionals!
`
 `
One of the biggest questions we get from new customers using the Cool Cube™ for the first time is “I don’t need buffering material???”…thus the first section. If you are not interested in the cold chain, the next two sections deal with medical kits (in-the-field care) and a system of supplies ready for a pandemic influenza outbreak. As always, have a productive week!

### A) No Insulating Material Needed!
#### _One of the toughest routines to break._
Well-seasoned professionals that have been transporting temp sensitive product for a long time usually say “Where has this been all my life?” when they use the Cool Cube™ the first time. However, they often can’t get over the fact that buffering material is NOT needed since they are so well trained to insulate the vaccine from the cold source. Now it doesn’t hurt anything (and may help limit the contents from shifting around inside) but using insulation to buffer the product from the Cool Cube™ phase change material (PCM) is like putting insulation in between each box or vial of vaccine within the cooler—it’s just not needed. The PCM is at 4.5°C/40.1°F, which is a super safe temperature for 2-8°C product. Therefore, pack the product right up against the panels; use all the space available; the panels are NOT too cold (they are not at 0°C like typical ice packs). A Cool Cube™ is simple…a lot simpler than figuring out how to layer ice packs, cardboard, bubble wrap, packing foam, Styrofoam™ and the vaccine all into an off-the-shelf cooler. If you haven’t seen what a Cool Cube™ can do for you, watch this quick [2-minute video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9G9pjNjopU&feature=youtu.be).
_(Although the focus was on a refrigerated temperature, the same principles apply to the frozen and room temp Cool Cube™ PCM Coolers.)_

### B) Fully Stocked Medical Kits
`
 `
#### _For care-specific mobility._
`
 `
More advanced than a first aid kit, VeriCor MedKits contain treatment-specific supplies that are organized within a portable, rolled-up, quick-to-deploy UMO (Upright Medical Organizer…an advanced “jump bag”). When in a pinch, the responding providers have exact locations of the supplies (bag # and pocket) to facilitate a more effective response. Choose from a wide range of pre-built MedKits, or let us customize one tailored to your needs.

### C) Pandemic Flu EP Cache
#### _A cache ready to respond._
A pandemic influenza outbreak typically strikes 3-4 times a century. Although considerable progress has been made in the last few years to prevent such outbreaks, health care communities still require preparedness supplies. VeriCor’s Pan-Flu Cache system is a methodized set of supplies ready to respond within a facility and/or at a non-traditional site. The Response-Friendly® approach assures that it has a compact storage footprint, is easily managed, is highly organized and rapidly deploys.
