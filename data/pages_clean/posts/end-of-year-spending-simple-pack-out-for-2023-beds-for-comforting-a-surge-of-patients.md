### A) A Premier Qualified Container & Packout
#### For vaccine, medicine, blood products, FFP and more.
If pack-out methods seem cumbersome and complicated to get right (the[ Packing Vaccines for Transport during Emergencies](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/recs/storage/downloads/emergency-transport.pdf), for example), maybe 2023 is the year to get an easy & qualified container and pack-out system. The Cool Cube™ is so simple to pack out. Prep the phase change panels, place them in the cooler, put in the product (no buffering needed), and go.

### C) Cold Chain Data Loggers
#### VFC Compliant
The cold chain is about controlling the environment of temperature-sensitive products so that the product is in optimal condition when needed. Exposure to any highs or lows results in significant problems. The CDC recommends using a specific temperature monitoring device called a Digital Data Logger (DDL). A DDL continuously monitors and records data points for review later. VeriCor carries a line of simple and affordable DDLs.
