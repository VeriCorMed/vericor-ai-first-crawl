Hello, medical professionals!
`
 `
Talk about comprehensive! Section “A” below provides a link to a FREE checklist every clinic coordinator/supervisor overseeing vaccinations should have (it’s not our own…but we wish it were). Section “B” continues the vaccination clinic conversation by talking about organizing all those supplies that will be needed this fall. Section “C” is for those preparedness folks thinking about pandemic influenza response scenarios. And did you notice the new inspirational quote above? Click it to download and use as you see fit (print, share, screensaver, etc.). If popular enough, we may produce another one next week. As always, have a productive week!

### A) Vaccination Clinic Step-By-Step Guide
#### Comprehensive and up-to-date (Feb 2019)!
[Here](https://www.izsummitpartners.org/content/uploads/2019/02/off-site-vaccination-clinic-checklist.pdf) is a direct link to what many consider the **best document to help personnel oversee vaccination clinics** held at satellite, temporary, or off-site locations. The checklist covers vaccine shipment, transport, storage, handling, preparation, administration, and documentation, and can be used in any non-traditional vaccination clinic setting (workplaces, community centers, schools, makeshift clinics in remote areas, medical facilities, etc.). Created by the Influenza Work Group of the National Adult and Influenza Immunization Summit, these guidelines and best practices are essential for patient safety and vaccine effectiveness.

### B) “Just Add Staff & Vaccine” Kits
#### All the supplies needed to run vaccination initiatives.
Counting, ordering and organizing all of the supplies needed for upcoming fall vaccination campaigns is time consuming and a pain. Save time and streamline the process with prepackaged kits from VeriCor. The easy-to-store, simple-to-move, “just add staff & vaccine” kits come in three sizes ([500](https://www.vericormed.com/product/vaccinator-500-go-bag-vaccination-module-vs-500gb/), [2500](https://www.vericormed.com/product/vaccinator-2500-go-system-vaccination-module-vs-2500gs/), [5000-person](https://www.vericormed.com/product/vaccinator-5000-system-with-refrigerator-vaccination-module-vs-5000r/)). The smaller kits are ideal for seasonal clinics, while the larger versions can be stored for pandemic preparedness. Already have the supplies but like the setup? Buy a [workstation](https://www.vericormed.com/mobile-medical-workstations/) to add organization and mobility to your arsenal (various sizes and configurations to choose from)!

### C) Pan Flu Supply Stockpile
#### An complete, organized system of supplies.
A pandemic influenza outbreak typically strikes 3-4 times a century. Although considerable progress has been made in the last few years to prevent such outbreaks, health care systems still need to be ready for outbreaks. VeriCor’s Pan-Flu Cache system is an organized set of supplies ready to respond. The Response-Friendly® methodology assures that despite its small storage footprint, it is easily managed, highly organized and rapidly deployable into any building of opportunity.
