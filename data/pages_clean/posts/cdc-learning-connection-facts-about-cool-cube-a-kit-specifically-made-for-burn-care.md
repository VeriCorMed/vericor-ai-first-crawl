### A) Facts about Cool Cube™ PCM Coolers.
#### Did you know?
The CDC had a picture of one of the first versions of the [Cool Cube™ 03](https://www.vericormed.com/product/cool-cube-03-at-fridge-temperatures-vt-03-vaccine-transport-cooler/) on the cover of the 2018 Vaccine Storage & Handling Toolkit. ([See that archived version here](https://www.vericormed.com/?wpfb_dl=696)).
The [Cool Cube™ 96 @ Refrigerated Temps](https://www.vericormed.com/product/cool-cube-96-vaccine-transport-cooler-at-refrigerated-temperatures-for-fresh-vaccine-vt-96/) can hold 134 boxes (or 1400 vials) of vaccine between 2-8°C for 126 hours (or 5+ days) in summer heat (a 71-95°F cycling temperature).
Utilizing just one of the phase change material (PCM) panels that comes with the [Cool Cube™ 08 @ Refrigerated Temps](https://www.vericormed.com/product/cooler-cool-cube-08-vaccine-transport-cooler-at-refrigerated-temperatures-fresh-vaccine-vt-08/) results in a 2-8°C hold time of 22 hours in an office environment. Utilizing all six PCM panels that it comes with, the time increases to more than 130 hours.
The Cool Cube™ 28 & 96 models have a dedicated pocket on the outside of the case, along with a cord port that enables the temperature probe to “pass thru” the case wall.
Cool Cube™ PCM coolers are being utilized in 49 of 50 states here in the USA. Customer testimonials are [here](https://www.vericormed.com/testimonials/).
