### B) Beds that are ready to respond.
#### Minimal storage – maximum flexibility!
When a disaster hits, one of the first things people turn to for comfort, rest and treatment are beds. The line of beds VeriCor carries meet FEMA guidelines (and ADA compliance standards) while having a folding design for easy and compact storage.
