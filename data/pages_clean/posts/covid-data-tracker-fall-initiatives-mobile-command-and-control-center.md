### A) Order Now for Fall Initiatives
#### You will need (more) Cool Cubes™ this fall!
Whether in need of a solution for drive-thru COVID immunization initiatives, prepping for future clinics, or implementing them into your new contingency plan, get in line now (lead-times keep fluctuating due to the supply chain)! These purpose-built coolers are pre-qualified to hold at precise temperatures during extended transport and storage. Cool Cube™ PCM Coolers are the go-to transporter for public health departments and hospitals across the country!

### B) Mobile Command and Control Center
#### A workstation for your HICS.
Establish command and control with a mobile HICS (Hospital Incident Command System) case. During storage, it can be out of the way and take up the footprint of a desk. But during deployment, it can transform into a serious multi-tool with a power management system, table, organizational chart, overhead light, laptop stand, inlay map/document grease board, and numerous drawers and shelves to enable supply organization. Pair it with the [HICS Support Module](https://www.vericormed.com/product/hospital-incident-command-support-module-sm-hics/) (or your kit), and be ready to respond anytime, anywhere.

### C) Supplies in the Right Position for Nurses
#### Roll these workstations to the point-of-care (POC).
Vaccination campaigns (or any mobile medical initiative) can involve more supplies than what providers want to drag around. VeriCor workstations give mobility to the load (bulky/heavy supplies) and organization to the plan. From stainless steel partitioned drawers for organization, to glove holders in the lid for accessibility, these workstations are primed and ready for the next mobile campaign!
