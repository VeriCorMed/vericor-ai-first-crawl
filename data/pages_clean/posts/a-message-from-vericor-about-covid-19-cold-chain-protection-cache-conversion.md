### A) COVID-19 Myths
#### Striving to be a responsible corporate citizen.

### A) Cold Chain Protection
#### For transport, back-up (contingencies), off-site and more.
In many cases, Cool Cube™ PCM Coolers are purchased to serve a variety of purposes. The first and most obvious use is to transport sensitive product from point A to point B. But then many times, that point B is an off-site clinic at which they get used as temporary refrigerators or freezers (2nd purpose). Since they work well at holding a specific fridge or freezer temperature, the third use is as a back-up fridge or freezer for when the power goes out. One product…so many uses!
If you haven’t already, watch this [113-second explainer](https://youtu.be/N9G9pjNjopU) video to see the simplicity and effectiveness of Cool Cube™ PCM Coolers.
