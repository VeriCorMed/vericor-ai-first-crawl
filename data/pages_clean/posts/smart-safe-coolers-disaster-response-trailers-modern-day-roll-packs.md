### SMART & SAFE Coolers![Cool Cubes™ - Literally!](https://www.vericormed.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/cool-cubes-literally-300x200.jpg)
#### for Vaccine, Blood, Pharmaceuticals
In addition to the safe and effective cooling system, Cool Cubes™ have remarkable insulation. Therefore, many customers choose not to utilize all six cooling panels (just like reducing the number of ice/gel packs for shorter trips). For instance, the VT-100 will hold a 2-8°C range for a lab validated 76+ hours with all six 4°C panels surrounding the payload. That same unit packed out with only one panel on the bottom will last 22 hours (still longer than the typical use time). What’s the benefit? The capacity is increased by 65% and the weight is decreased by 54%. It’s smart, it’s easy, it’s safe…it’s a Cool Cube™!
