### A) When/How to Pack Out a Cool Cube™ for Refrigerator Temperatures
#### PDFs and videos are available online!
No matter what type of cooler is used, the when and how questions about the pack-out procedures are always abundant. If using ice, layers of buffering material, placement, and timing are all critical to get right. The slightest error decreases vaccine potency (not good for many reasons). If using poorly insulated containers, temperature excursions can happen quickly, resulting in a useless vaccine supply.
With Cool Cube™ PCM coolers, pack-out is dependable and straightforward. In short, get the PCM panels into a solid state and assemble them into the Cool Cube™ with a temperature monitor. Once in the desired range, pack out the vaccine (or other temperature-sensitive product), and that’s it. In refrigerator temp Cool Cubes™, the holding temperature will level off around an engineered 5 °C until fully melted (as opposed to ice which levels off around 1 °C—out of vaccine temperature parameters). The reason for the temperature leveling off at 5 °C for so long (65+ hours; moving only hundredths of a degree per hour) is the incredible Temp-Shield™ Insulation system of the Cool Cube™. (Plus, buffering material is not even needed—the panels are at 5 °C.)
The various ways to get Cool Cube™ PCM panels into a solid state can be found on [this webpage (it has printable PDFs and videos)](https://www.vericormed.com/cool-cube-training-videos/).

### A) Transport, Back-Up & Off-Site Vaccine Cooler
#### One cooler for it all!
**Transport** – Born out of shipping industry standards, the Cool Cube™ is thoroughly tested and proven over time for safe vaccine/blood/pharma transport.
**Back-Up** – Maintains 2-8°C (or frozen temps) for days without ice or electricity, making it ideal for contingency plans.
**Off-Site** – Insulation is the best on the planet; superior performance without the bulk makes the coolers perfect for remote locations.
