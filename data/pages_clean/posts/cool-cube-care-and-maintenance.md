### A) Cool Cube™ Care & Maintenance
#### How to inspect and validate coolers as they get older.
Thirteen-year-old Cool Cube™ PCM coolers are still in the field and transporting valuable temperature-sensitive material (vaccine, blood, varicella, medicine, platelets, etc.). So, with a bit of care and a few helpful tips, you too can expect a long life from your Cool Cube™ PCM cooler.

### A) Cool Cube™ vs. Others
#### What’s the difference?
When comparing the Cool Cube™ to other vaccine carriers, look at two things:
  1. **The “Coolant”** — affects the hold temperature and warm/cold spots within. Melting/freezing points in passive units should be within the targeted temperature range. Water, which freezes at 0°C/32°F, is too cold for refrigerated applications and too warm for freezer temperatures. Configurations that utilize “blocks” or “packs” result in warm and cold spots. Cool Cube™ PCM Coolers utilize patented PCM panels at an ideal melting/freezing point that fit together to form a closed chamber.
  2. **The Insulation** — affects hold time and warm/cold spots within. The better the insulation, the longer product is at the correct temperature. If not uniform in coverage, warm and cool spots occur. Cool Cube™ PCM Coolers utilize vacuum insulated panels around the product, the best insulator on (& off) the planet.

### B) The Compact & Mobile HICS Station
#### Move it to where you need it!
Establish command and control with a mobile HICS (Hospital Incident Command System) station. During storage, it will be out of the way and take up the footprint of a desk. During deployment, it transforms into a great multi-tool with a power management system, table, organizational chart, overhead light, laptop stand, inlay map/document grease board, and numerous drawers and shelves to enable supply organization. Pair it with the [HICS Support Module](https://www.vericormed.com/product/hospital-incident-command-support-module-sm-hics/) (or your kit), and be ready to respond anytime and anywhere!

### C) Workstations Made for Vaccination Campaigns
#### w/ integrated medical fridge.
Vaccination campaigns (or any mobile medical initiative) can involve bulky supplies providers don’t want to carry around. VeriCor workstations mobilize and organize those assets so that campaigns become a breeze. From stainless steel partitioned drawers to glove holders in the lid for accessibility, these workstations are primed and ready for use.
