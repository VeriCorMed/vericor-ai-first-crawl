### A) From Shorts to Shovels 😂
#### In Wisconsin
Many times we get the question, “Where are you located?” We are located right along the Mississippi River in southwestern Wisconsin. A place where it was 90°F last Wednesday and then had 18″ of snowfall Sunday. The extreme conditions are a great place to test our Cool Cube™ but not so great a place to test tree limb strength (many came down onto power lines around the area). So, pardon the interruption Monday morning, but we are back up and running!

### A) Keep Products Safe During Transport
#### The Ultimate Temperature Control Solution
PCM (Phase Change Material) is a highly effective means of achieving passive temperature control. However, selecting the appropriate PCM for your temperature-sensitive products is paramount. PCM with too low of a melting point, such as water or ice, may cause damage to the products being transported. Conversely, PCM with too high a melting point may not remain in the desired temperature range for a sufficient period. Fortunately, Cool Cube™ PCM coolers offered by VeriCor provide an ideal solution for various popular applications. Whether for refrigeration, ultra-cold temperature control, or room temperature maintenance, the Cool Cube™ PCM is designed to meet the unique demands of each scenario.

### C) From the Battlefield to the Emergency Room
#### VeriCor’s Mobile ER
Forward Surgical Teams (FSTs) are compact, mobile surgical units that provide advanced medical care in the United States Army. These teams offer critical support within the “golden hour” of injury during mass casualty incidents. VeriCor revamped this concept into a mobile emergency room system for healthcare coalition preparedness. We designed our mobile units to provide a comprehensive and flexible solution to a wide range of medical emergencies. For additional information on how VeriCor’s mobile emergency room systems can benefit your organization, please click the provided picture (or button) or call 608-526-6901 to speak with one of our experienced staff members today.
