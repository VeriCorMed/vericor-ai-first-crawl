### A) Moderna Storage & Transport
#### A helpful log put out by the CDC.
Recently published on the CDC’s website is a Temperature Log for the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine ([download here](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/info-by-product/moderna/downloads/temp-log-freezer-storage-celsius.pdf)). Use one of the options on the log to check and record the temperature between the required -25°C and -15°C during storage and transport.
And if you didn’t realize, the Cool Cube™ at Lab Freezer temps ([FT-03](https://www.vericormed.com/product/cool-cube-03-varicella-medical-transport-cooler-at-frozen-temperatures-also-for-mmrv-zoster-and-ffp-ft-03/), [FT-08](https://www.vericormed.com/product/cool-cube-08-varicella-medical-transport-cooler-at-frozen-temperatures-also-for-mmrv-zoster-and-ffp-ft-08/), [FT-28](https://www.vericormed.com/product/cool-cube-28-varicella-medical-transport-cooler-at-frozen-temperatures-also-for-mmrv-zoster-and-ffp-ft-28/), and [FT-96](https://www.vericormed.com/product/cool-cube-96-varicella-medical-transport-cooler-at-frozen-temperatures-also-for-mmrv-zoster-and-ffp-ft-96/)) are already prequalified container and pack-out systems ideal for storing/transporting the Moderna vaccine for 60+ hours without using ice, electricity, or dry ice. And if you have a Cool Cube™ already but just not the lab freezer version, all you need to do is purchase the panel system to fit your Cool Cube™ and you are all set ([varieties here](https://www.vericormed.com/small-medium-large-cool-cube-components/)).

### B) Roll into Position
#### Nurses can work right from these workstations.
Vaccination campaigns (or any mobile medical initiative) can involve more supplies than what providers want to drag around. VeriCor workstations give mobility to the load (bulky/heavy supplies) and organization to the plan. From stainless steel partitioned drawers for organization, to glove holders in the lid for accessibility, these workstations are primed and ready for the next mobile campaign!
