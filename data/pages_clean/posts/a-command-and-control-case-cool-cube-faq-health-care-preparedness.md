### A Command and Control Case![Mobile HICS Station](https://www.vericormed.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Mobile-HICS-Station-300x200.jpg)
#### Anywhere & Anytime
In preparation for the next logistical, operational or command situation, organize needed supplies within an extremely adaptable Hospital Incident Command Station. In storage it takes up the space of a desk. In deployment it facilitates command and control while on-the-go. A built-in laptop stand, overhead light, inlay map/document grease board, and two Easyboards® are just a few of the features of this case. Pair it with the [HICS Support Module](https://www.vericormed.com/product/hospital-incident-command-support-module-sm-hics/) (or your own kit) and be ready to respond anytime, anywhere.

### Cool Cube™ FAQ![Cool Cube™ FAQ](https://www.vericormed.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/cool-cube-faq-300x200.jpg)
#### A Question From Your Colleagues
**Question:** Is an active-display logger integrated into the Cool Cube™?

**Answer:** No, but it is ready to accommodate one if needed. A Cool Cube™ phase change material (PCM) cooler is so reliable and steady that many users find it unnecessary to constantly monitor the temperature. There are no moving parts, and once it is packed out it stays at that needed temperature for days. As one customer wrote “it stood up to the test by not deviating even one degree.” Yet regulations often drive SOPs. That is why all Cool Cube™ models come with features to enable the integration of a calibrated, active-display data logger: outside pockets, cord pass-throughs, temp card reminders, etc. In case you don’t have a monitor…we have those too.

#### The “Golden Hour” Answer
FSTs (Forward Surgical Teams) are small, mobile surgical units in the United States Army. With some rethinking and hard work, VeriCor retooled the FST concept into a system for health care coalitions — the Response-Friendly® Mobile Emergency Room (ER). This system supports advanced levels of care typically needed within the “golden hour” of injury. Be ready when disaster strikes with this complete, efficient and simple patient surge system.
