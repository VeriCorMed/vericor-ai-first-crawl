### A) Travel with Confidence Through TSA
#### Your Prescription for Perfectly Chilled Travel
Users are consistently amazed by the reliable temperature control of the Cool Cube™, and that’s one of the reasons they’ve become such a boon for long-haul journeys. Whether it’s for medications, vaccines, or other temperature-sensitive goodies, these Cool Cube™ PCM coolers maintain a steady 5°C/41°F for refrigerated items and a brisk -20°C/-4°F for frozen ones, all for a good three days or more. And the best part? There is no need for the messy, overly cold ice or troublesome electricity.
Now, rest assured that those worried about the whole Transportation Security Administration (TSA) screening ordeal are perfectly fine with it. You can even find their official stance on their [website](https://www.tsa.gov/travel/security-screening/whatcanibring/items/gel-ice-packs). But to ease your mind a bit more, VeriCor recommends carrying a printout of one of the TSA travel documents: [refrigerator, lab freezer, or room temp panels](https://www.vericormed.com/download-pdf/cool-cube-travel-document-refrigerator-models/). Although they say it’s not strictly necessary, better safe than sorry!
