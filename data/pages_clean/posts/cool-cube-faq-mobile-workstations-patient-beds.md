#### A Question From Colleagues
**Question:** Are Cool Cube™ PCM coolers “hard-sided”?

**Answer:** Yes. All Cool Cube™ coolers have a hard shell that sits within the exterior case/bag. So even though the two smaller models (03 & 08) have canvas-like fabric, outer carrying cases, within those bags are rigid, inflexible, insulation shells that do not bend under pressure. Take a brief moment to view the general construction of the Cool Cube™ (@ 1:02) in this [short video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9G9pjNjopU&feature=youtu.be).

#### Assets for a Smooth EP Response ®
Vaccination campaigns, or any mobile medical initiative, can involve more supplies than what providers want to tote around. VeriCor workstations give mobility to the load (bulky/heavy supplies) and organization to the plan in order to support a variety of needs.
