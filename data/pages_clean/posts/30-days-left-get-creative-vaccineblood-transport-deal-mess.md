**Alternatives to the DIY Madness**

Vaccine/blood transport — a necessity that in many instances ends up being a DIY project. The shopping, testing, validating, training and other headaches associated with figuring out a cooler and pack-out system can be overwhelming, not to mention costly if things don’t go right. That’s why we created Cool Cubes™. They’re easy: one quick pack-out for all seasons. They’re qualified: lab validated under ISTA 7D. They’re safe: no ice yet lasts for days.

**Convert a “Cache” into a System**

Expired? Organized? Recalled? If something happened today, is the hospital or emergency team’s cache of equipment and supplies ready to enhance/expand the delivery of disaster care while waiting for federal emergency assistance? If not, it can be. With hard work and attention to detail, VeriCor’s Medical Cache Conversion process converts the customer’s mess of supplies into an organized, ready-to-respond system that is now easily managed.
