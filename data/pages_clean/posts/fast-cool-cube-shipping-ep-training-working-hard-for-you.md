#### Cool Cube™ FAQ
**Question:** Can I get it in time for fall flu clinics?

**Answer:** Yes. Most Cool Cube™ orders ship out next day at this time of year. However, as it gets closer to the fall flu clinic season, there always seems to be those larger orders (100-500 units) that disrupt normal lead times. So if you are looking to use Cool Cube™ PCM Coolers this fall, purchase them now to ensure a speedy delivery and a worry-free season of cold chain management.
