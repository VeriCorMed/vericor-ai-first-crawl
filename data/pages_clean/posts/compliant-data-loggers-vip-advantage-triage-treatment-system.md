### The VIP Advantage![say no to frozen bottles Cool Cube™ Insulation](https://www.vericormed.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/cc2-1-300x200.jpg)
#### Cool Cube™ Vacuum Insulation
Some coolers are bulky. Others cannot hold a temperature for very long. The Cool Cube™ solves both problems. At just 1″ thick, its vacuum insulated panels (VIPs) perform better than 3.3″ of polyurethane — the insulation found in other high-performance coolers. This unique feature (one of many) ensures that sensitive product placed inside stays at the right temperature for days. Industry-leading Cool Cubes™ are what many states and institutions are moving towards to regain control of the cold chain…and isn’t life-saving vaccine/blood/medicine worth it?
