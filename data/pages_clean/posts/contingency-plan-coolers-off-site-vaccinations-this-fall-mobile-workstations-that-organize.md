### A) The COVID-19 Effect: Everything is a bit slower.
#### Order now to be prepared!
From purchasing, to fulfillment, to shipping—everything seems to be taking a bit longer than what we are used to, right? And although we are striving to be the exception, here at VeriCor we are experiencing what others are experiencing—delays. Whether it’s a rise in demand of our products, to longer lead times from suppliers, to decreased efficiency due COVID-19 precautions, there are many reasons things are taking a bit longer these days. So please bear with us as we navigate these unprecedented times. And if possible, order now to give us, and you, a few more days to deliver before you really need it. Thank you!

### A) Vaccine Storage — Contingency Plan Coolers
#### Designed for when the power goes out!
The [Cool Cube™ 96 @ Refrigerated Temps](https://www.vericormed.com/product/cool-cube-96-vaccine-transport-cooler-at-refrigerated-temperatures-for-fresh-vaccine-vt-96/) is the ultimate contingency plan cooler:
  * Massive space—96 liters (a whole fridge???).
  * Very safe—uses 4.5°C PCM (not 0°C ice).
  * Long-lasting—over 126 hours (in HOT weather).
  * Mobile—wheels for easy transport (& pockets).

Check out its smaller brother, the [Cool Cube™ 28 @ Refrigerated Temps](https://www.vericormed.com/product/cooler-cool-cube-28-vaccine-transport-cooler-at-refrigerated-temperatures-fresh-vaccine-vt-28/) that has a lot of space itself.
If you haven’t already, watch this [113-second explainer video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9G9pjNjopU&feature=youtu.be) to see the simplicity and effectiveness of Cool Cube™ PCM Coolers.

### B) Be ready for off-site vaccinations this fall!
#### Mobilized kits for immunization professionals.
Do you anticipate more off-site vaccination clinics this year than ever before (whether or not the COVID-19 vaccine is ready)? You can bet on it. Save time and streamline campaigns with prepackaged kits from VeriCor. The easy-to-store, simple-to-move, “just add staff & vaccine” packages come in three sizes ([500](https://www.vericormed.com/product/vaccinator-500-go-bag-vaccination-module-vs-500gb/), [2500](https://www.vericormed.com/product/vaccinator-2500-go-system-vaccination-module-vs-2500gs/), [5000-person](https://www.vericormed.com/product/vaccinator-5000-system-with-refrigerator-vaccination-module-vs-5000r/)). The smaller kits are ideal for seasonal clinics, while the larger “systems” can be stored for pandemic preparedness. Already have the supplies but like the setup? Buy a Go-Bag or workstation to make your own vaccination campaign go-system.

### C) Mobile workstations that organize supplies.
#### Roll it into position—open—treat patients.
Vaccination campaigns (or any mobile medical initiative) can involve more supplies than what providers want to drag around. VeriCor workstations give mobility to the load (bulky/heavy supplies) and organization to the plan. From stainless steel partitioned drawers for organization, to glove holders in the lid for accessibility, these workstations are primed and ready for the next mobile campaign.
