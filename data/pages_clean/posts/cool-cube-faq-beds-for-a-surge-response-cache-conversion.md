### Cool Cube™ FAQ![How many times can the Cool Cube™ be opened](https://www.vericormed.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/how-many-times-can-the-cool-cube-be-opened-300x200.jpg)
#### A Question From Your Colleagues
**Question:** How many times can the Cool Cube™ be opened?

**Answer:** A lot. Unlike a fridge that when opened cold air escapes out the bottom and warm air enters from the top, the Cool Cube™ has a top-open design. When opened, the cool air stays down within the unit while the warm, ambient air stays above it. Once closed, the phase change material (PCM) that surrounds the product quickly cools any warm air trapped inside. To supplement customer testimonies corroborating this phenomenon, a test was run over a 3-day period. During the 82 hours it was within range (2-8°C), the VT-08 was logged as opened 56 times in a warm, humid environment.
