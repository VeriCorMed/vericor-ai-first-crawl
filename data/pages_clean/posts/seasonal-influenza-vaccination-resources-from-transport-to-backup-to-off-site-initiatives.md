### A) Four Sizes for Various Needs
#### From transport to backup to off-site initiatives.
Cool Cube™ PCM coolers come in four sizes:
  * The “03” is ideal for small payloads going off-site.
  * The “08” holds plenty and still be over-the-shoulder.
  * The “28” wheels around for more significant initiatives.
  * The “96” fits a whole freezer/fridge worth of vaccine (literally).

All have the same PCM technology (for safe temperatures) and premium insulation system (for 3+ days of temperature holding).
