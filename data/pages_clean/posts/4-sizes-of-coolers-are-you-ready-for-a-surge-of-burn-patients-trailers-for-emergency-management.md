500 million people infected! Can you name it?
The world looks very different than it did 101 years ago when that happened. For one thing, there are much better cold chain management tools (that’s our small contribution). If interested in this topic, the World Health Organization has a page you should check out…[Influenza: are we ready?](https://www.who.int/influenza/spotlight)
And as always, lots of information can be found on our website.
Have a productive week!

### A) 4 Sizes of Coolers
#### From easy-carry to big-backup.
Cool Cube™ PCM coolers come in four sizes:
  * The “03” is ideal for smaller payloads.
  * The “08” holds just enough to carry over-the-shoulder.
  * The “28” wheels around for larger initiatives.
  * The “96” fits the whole freezer/fridge (not literally).

All have the same PCM system (for safe temperatures) and insulation system (for long hold times). New to this email? Watch this [113-second video](https://youtu.be/N9G9pjNjopU) explaining the simplicity and effectiveness of Cool Cube™ PCM Coolers.
