### A) Simplify the Pack Out Process
#### This is the safest cooler for temp sensitive product!
If old packout methods seem cumbersome and hard to get right (e.g. “[Packing Vaccines for Transport during Emergencies](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/recs/storage/downloads/emergency-transport.pdf)“), maybe this is the year to get a Cool Cube™—an easy, qualified, container and packout system. It’s as simple as preparing the phase change panels(very easy), placing them in the cooler (there’s only one way to do it), loading in the product (no buffering material needed), and away you go (easy to carry or pull—depending on size).
If you haven’t already, watch this [113-second explainer video](https://youtu.be/N9G9pjNjopU) to see the simplicity and effectiveness of Cool Cube™ PCM Coolers.

### B) Compact Command and Control
#### A Hospital Incident Command System Case.
Establish command and control with a mobile HICS (Hospital Incident Command System) case. During storage, it can be out of the way and take up the footprint of a desk. But during deployment, it can transform into a serious multi-tool with a power management system, table, organizational chart, overhead light, laptop stand, inlay map/document grease board, and numerous drawers and shelves to enable supply organization. Pair it with the HICS Support Module (or your own kit) and be ready to respond anytime, anywhere.
