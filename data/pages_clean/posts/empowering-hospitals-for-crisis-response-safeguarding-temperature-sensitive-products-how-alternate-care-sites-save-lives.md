### A) Empowering Hospitals for Crisis Response
#### ASPR’s Hospital Preparedness Program
Hospitals and healthcare facilities typically operate independently while providing care to communities nationwide. During disasters, they must face new challenges and require robust plans and partnerships in place beforehand to save lives. The ASPR’s Hospital Preparedness Program (HPP) offers leadership and funding through cooperative agreements to states, territories, and eligible metropolitan areas. Learn more about HPP, the requirements, flexibilities, and funding at [https://aspr.hhs.gov/HealthCareReadiness/HPP](https://aspr.hhs.gov/HealthCareReadiness/HPP/Pages/default.aspx). (Here are some feel-good [Stories from the Field](https://aspr.hhs.gov/HealthCareReadiness/StoriesfromtheField/Pages/default.aspx).)

### A) Safeguarding Temperature-Sensitive Products
#### Beat the Heat and Blackouts
Power outages pose significant challenges for temperature-sensitive products, as experienced by many VeriCor customers before getting Cool Cubes™. Safeguarding vaccines and other products during blackouts is daunting, especially considering that standard medical-grade fridges can exceed 8°C/46°F within just a few hours after losing power. To address this critical issue, Cool Cube™ PCM coolers offer a reliable solution. These coolers maintain a precise temperature range for several days without requiring ice or electricity and ensure the safety and ease of transporting the products when necessary. If you haven’t already, we invite you to watch the [113-second explainer video](https://youtu.be/N9G9pjNjopU) demonstrating valuable insights into the benefits and reliability of Cool Cube™ PCM coolers for temperature-sensitive products.

### B) How Alternate Care Sites Save Lives
`
 `
#### Beyond Capacity
`
 `
`
 `Alternate care sites (ACSs) are essential to emergency and disaster preparedness in the healthcare industry. During times of crisis (natural disasters, pandemics, or other emergencies), the demand for healthcare services can quickly exceed the available resources. Alternate care sites provide additional patient care areas and beds to alleviate overcrowding in the fixed facilities, ensuring that patients can receive the care they need, even in challenging circumstances. Healthcare organizations can ensure that they are equipped to provide adequate care and protect their patients and staff’s health and safety during times of crisis by planning and implementing an ACS as part of a disaster preparedness plan.

### C) VeriCor’s Mobile ER Units for Mass Casualty Incidents
`
 `
#### Beyond the Golden Hour
`
 `
`
 `Forward Surgical Teams (FSTs) are compact, mobile surgical units that provide advanced medical care in the United States Army. These teams offer critical support within the “golden hour” of injury during mass casualty incidents. VeriCor revamped this concept into a mobile emergency room system for healthcare coalition preparedness. We designed our mobile units to provide a comprehensive and flexible solution to various medical emergencies. For additional information on how VeriCor’s mobile emergency room systems can benefit your organization, please click the provided picture (or button) or call 608-526-6901 to speak with one of our experienced staff members today.
