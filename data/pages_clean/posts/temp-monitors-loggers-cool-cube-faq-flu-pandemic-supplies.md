#### Basic? Wi-Fi? What to choose…
Gone are the days of pen and paper notes proving the cold chain was not broken. Instead, spreadsheets with up-to-the-minute temperatures create a detailed picture of the past (and present) storage condition of temperature sensitive product. VeriCor carries a variety of loggers that are CDC/FDA compliant. Need help choosing? Use this handy chart (click here) to figure out the model best for your needs.

### Cool Cube™ FAQ![The Impact of Data Loggers](https://www.vericormed.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/The-Impact-of-Data-Loggers-300x200.jpg)
#### A Question From Your Colleagues
**Question:** “I need these for an upcoming clinic…how quickly can I get my order?”

**Answer:** “Is tomorrow soon enough?” Normally customers do not need such expediting. However with the flu clinic season upon us, these requests become more frequent. So if you are in a bind and need a qualified container and pack-out system to keep clinic vaccine safe, order a Cool Cube™ and hopefully we can ship it out today. Cool Cube™ PCM coolers don’t rely on ice or electricity to maintain product temperature for 3+ days, and are extremely simple to use (view a short 2-minute video here).

#### A Stockpile Ready to Respond
A pandemic influenza outbreak typically strikes 3-4 times a century. Although considerable progress has been made in the last few years to prevent such outbreaks, health care communities still require preparedness supplies. VeriCor’s Pan-Flu Cache system is a methodized set of supplies ready to respond within a facility and/or at a non-traditional site. The Response-Friendly® approach assures that it has a compact storage footprint, is easily managed, is highly organized and rapidly deploys.
