### A) Vaccine Storage and Handling Toolkit
#### Updated on March 29, 2024
The Vaccine Storage and Handling Toolkit is a comprehensive guide that reflects best practices for vaccine storage and handling from Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommendations, product information from vaccine manufacturers, and scientific studies. The entire “Toolkit” is comprised of three separate PDFs (rather than the 70-page PDF of 2023):
  * [Vaccine Storage and Handling Toolkit](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/admin/storage/toolkit/storage-handling-toolkit.pdf)
  * [Vaccine Storage and Handling Toolkit Resources](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/admin/storage/toolkit/storage-handling-toolkit-resources.pdf)
  * [Vaccine Storage and Handling Toolkit Addendum](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/admin/storage/toolkit/storage-handling-toolkit-addendum.pdf)

The most notable change is the clarified language of Mpox vaccine information.

### A) Keeping Cool Under Pressure
#### Essential Solutions for the Temperature-Sensitive
Ensuring the safe and efficient transportation of temperature-sensitive cargo is paramount within the medical field. Effective cold chain management becomes critical as many pharmaceuticals require strictly controlled environments. Implementing appropriate transport solutions, such as Phase Change Material (PCM) transport coolers (Cool Cubes™) and real-time monitoring systems (digital temperature loggers), is essential to safeguard product integrity and minimize potential wastage.
