Each module caters to a specific set of capabilities, with its corresponding equipment and supplies housed within various designated mobile cases. A complete[Hospital Triage and Treatment System](https://www.vericormed.com/triage-and-treatment/) likely takes up the footprint of your office)._

**Training and Drills**

  * **Integrate regular training:** Equip healthcare personnel with the knowledge and skills to utilize surge capacity equipment.
  * **Conduct periodic drills:** Regularly simulate emergencies to test and refine the surge capacity plan.
  * **Engage in thorough debriefings:** Analyze drills to identify areas for improvement and ensure continuous enhancement.

_(Did you know that VeriCor offers[training services](https://www.vericormed.com/system-training/) on their systems? Deployment techniques, equipment familiarization, and product management are some highlights.)_

**Communication and Coordination**

  * **Establish a clear chain of command:** Ensure efficient decision-making during emergencies.
  * **Foster effective communication channels:** Create seamless communication between hospitals, public health agencies, and emergency responders.
