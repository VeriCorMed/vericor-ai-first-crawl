### A) Safeguarding Children’s Health
#### Reliable Vaccine Transport for VFC Providers
The Vaccines for Children (VFC) program ensures all children have access to essential immunizations by providing free vaccines to those who qualify. To maintain vaccine efficacy and provide optimal protection against disease, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) mandates proper transportation and storage. VFC-compliant solutions, such as Cool Cube™ PCM coolers, are reliable for adhering to these guidelines. These innovative coolers utilize phase change material (PCM) panels to maintain consistent temperatures for over three days, even in extreme conditions. The interchangeable PCM panels also allow for precise temperature control across various ranges, all without relying on electricity. This ensures the safe transport of vaccines, making Cool Cube™ PCM coolers a valuable tool for VFC providers.
