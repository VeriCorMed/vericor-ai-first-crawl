# DDL is the TMD that CDC Recommends | The Hot and Cool Barrier | Nursing Stations on Wheels

Hello, medical professionals!
There’s been a lot of talk about the difference between Cool Cubes™ and other “cold chain coolers.” If cold chain management is part of your job, you will want to read the first section below. The next two sections also stay in the vaccination arena and deal with DDLs (digital data loggers) and vaccination workstations. As always, have a productive week!

### A) DDL is the TMD that CDC Recommends
`
 `
#### _Did you get all of that?_
DDL – Digital Data Logger
TMD – Temperature Monitoring Device
CDC – Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
Simply put, the CDC is taking vaccine storage and transport seriously. They want digital proof of the vaccine’s temperature, and that data is to be kept for 3 years or more (depending on state regulations). If you need to get a new DDL or are looking to upgrade, check out this [interactive chart](https://www.vericormed.com/?wpfb_dl=644) to figure out the model best suited for your needs.

### B) The 4.5°C/40.1°F Barrier
#### _Hot and cold temperatures don’t stand a chance._
What makes a Cool Cube™ PCM cooler so great is the combination of two outstanding technologies.
Like most coolers on the market it has insulation. But it’s not the typical polypropylene that 99% of other coolers utilize. The high-performance, vacuum insulation that each Cool Cube™ has is 5X more efficient than polypropylene. And with that type of barrier on all six sides (including the top!), it’s no wonder the temperature remains stable for days. But that is only the first of two technologies.
The second tech is PCM (phase change material). If the cold or warmth is persistent enough, then it meets a 1″ thick, 4.5°C (40.1°C) barrier utilizing phase change technology. This technology keeps the inside of the cooler at 4.5°C as it absorbs the warm and/or cold trying to get in. Not until all PCM panels change their state does the temperature of the cooler fluctuate.
Two outstanding technologies–one awesome cold chain cooler! (Actually there are four sizes of coolers and with two other temperature ranges…all with the same technology.) If you haven’t seen it, watch this quick [2-minute video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9G9pjNjopU&feature=youtu.be).

### C) Nursing Stations on Wheels
#### _For in-the-field care or off-site clinics._
Vaccination campaigns (or any mobile medical initiative) can involve more supplies than what providers want to drag around. VeriCor workstations give mobility to the load (bulky/heavy supplies) and organization to the plan. From stainless steel partitioned drawers for organization, to glove holders in the lid for accessibility, these workstations are primed and ready for the next mobile campaign.
