### A) From Hurricanes to Wildfires
#### Emergency Preparedness & Climate Change Resilience
With the increasing frequency and severity of natural disasters such as hurricanes, wildfires, and floods, building resilience to climate change has become crucial. Emergency preparedness (EP) efforts now encompass strategies to mitigate and adapt to the impacts of climate change. EP involves investing in infrastructure improvements, implementing early warning systems, and enhancing disaster response capabilities to minimize the impact of extreme weather events. To read more about FEMA’s Role in Addressing Climate Change, visit: <https://www.fema.gov/fact-sheet/fema-and-changing-climate>. (The [National Risk Index](https://hazards.fema.gov/nri/map) is a fantastic tool showing your county’s risk rating for 18 natural hazards.)
