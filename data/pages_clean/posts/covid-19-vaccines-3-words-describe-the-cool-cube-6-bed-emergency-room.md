### A) What 3 words describe the Cool Cube™?
#### Easy – Fast – Safe.
The Cool Cube™ is the easiest, fastest and safest cooler on the market to prep. Easiest because patented PCM panels simplify pack-out. Fastest because there isn’t any buffering material or layering to mess around with. Safest because there’s not any traditional ice to drop the temperature too low.
