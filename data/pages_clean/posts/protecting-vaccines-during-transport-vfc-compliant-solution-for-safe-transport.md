### A) Protecting Vaccines During Transport
#### The Basics
To protect vaccines against a temperature excursion during transport, be sure to take the necessary precautions:
_Use temperature-controlled packaging._
Transporters should use packaging designed to maintain the temperature of vaccines during transportation. Be sure to adhere to the specific needs of the vaccine.
  * Qualified Cool Cube™ PCM Coolers are easy, safe, and VFC compliant (see below).

_Monitor the temperature._
During transport, personnel should use temperature monitoring devices (TMDs) to ensure that vaccines remain within the recommended temperature range. Use a continuous TMD, preferably a digital data logger, with capabilities defined by the CDC.
  * VeriCor carries a line of digital data loggers that meet CDC recommendations (see below).

_Train staff._
Adequately train staff members responsible for transporting vaccines on how to handle and monitor the vaccines during transport. They should be aware of the temperature requirements for each vaccine and how to pack out packaging and the logger properly.

_Plan._
Transport materials and contingency plans should minimize issues leading to an excursion. This can include having backup materials and procedures for power outages.
  * Cool Cube™ PCM coolers have interchangeable panels, enabling providers to control multiple temperatures without having electricity.

Vaccine transporters can help protect vaccines against excursions during transport and maintain their effectiveness by taking the necessary precautions.

### A) A VFC Compliant Solution for Safe Transport
#### Cool Cube™ PCM Coolers.
The Vaccines for Children (VFC) program offers free vaccines to children who cannot afford them. As such, VFC providers are responsible for ensuring that vaccines are transported and stored safely. VFC-compliant solutions like Cool Cube™ PCM coolers can help ensure that vaccines are transported and stored safely, so they remain effective and provide the necessary protection against diseases. The innovative phase change material (PCM) panels maintain a constant temperature for over three days, even in extreme temperatures, and are also interchangeable allowing for precise temperature control, in multiple temperature ranges, without electricity. Cool Cube™ PCM Coolers maintain the temperature of vaccines during transportation, making them a VFC-compliant solution for safe vaccine transport.
