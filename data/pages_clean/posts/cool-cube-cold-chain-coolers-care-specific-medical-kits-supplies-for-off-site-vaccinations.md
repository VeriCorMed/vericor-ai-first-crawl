Hello, medical professionals!
There’s been a lot of talk about the difference between Cool Cubes™ and other “cold chain coolers.” If cold chain management is part of your job, you will want to read the first section below. The next two sections also stay in the vaccination arena and deal with DDLs (digital data loggers) and vaccination workstations. As always, have a productive week!

### A) Cool Cube™ Cold Chain Coolers
#### Lives are at stake!
With lives on the line, medical personnel are to protect the quality attributes of vaccine, blood and medicine for their patients. Controlling the storage and transport conditions play a key role in this protection. The problem is proper equipment is not being used to control conditions.
Basic coolers with ice or gel packs are good for soft drinks, but not for life-saving products. Ice at zero degrees is not within any of the regulated parameters that vaccine, blood, varicella, FFP or medicine needs to be stored or transported at. So using it can result in temperature excursions—too high as well as too low—that jeopardized the safety, efficacy and quality of the product—a patient’s lifeline.
That’s why VeriCor is empowering the medical community with Cool Cubes™.
Cool Cubes™ are built for medical personnel: to transport vaccine to a remote clinic; to carry units of blood to the scene of an accident; to hold naloxone at room temperature in a hot car; to maintain varicella in a frozen state during a blackout.
Cool Cubes™ are temperature assurance—without ice or electricity. The combined attributes of temperature-controlling technology (PCM panels), transfer-resistant barriers (vacuum insulation) and user-friendly cases make Cool Cubes™ innovative, but more importantly safe and effective.
All VeriCor Cool Cubes™ have been engineered and tested under extreme conditions to last for DAYS. And the best thing is—they are simple to use.
Lives are at stake. So get rid of the off-the-shelf coolers; forget the bottles of ice. Cool Cubes™ are a safe and easy container and pack-out system for medical professionals who want to protect the quality attributes of their product.

### B) Care-Specific Medical Kits
#### 13 Prepackaged MedKits for Emergency Response Scenarios
More advanced than a first aid kit, VeriCor MedKits contain treatment-specific supplies that are organized within a portable, rolled-up, quick-to-deploy UMO (Upright Medical Organizer…an advanced “jump bag”). In the field, responders see contents within the pockets to facilitate faster treatment. Choose from a wide range of pre-built MedKits (Airway, Burn Care, Examination, IV Therapy, Med Admin, PPE, Surgical, Wound Care, etc.), or let us customize one tailored to your needs.
