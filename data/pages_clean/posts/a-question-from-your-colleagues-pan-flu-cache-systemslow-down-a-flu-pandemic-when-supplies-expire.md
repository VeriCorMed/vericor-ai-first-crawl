### A Question from Your Colleagues[![A Question from Your Colleagues](https://www.vericormed.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/A-Question-from-Your-Colleagues-300x200.jpg)](https://www.vericormed.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/A-Question-from-Your-Colleagues.jpg)
#### Cool Cube™ FAQ
**Question:** Is buffering material needed?

**Answer:** No. The phase change material (PCM) panels that control the temperature of the Cool Cube™ are very close to, if not at, the temperature of the product. So when packed-out, PCM surrounds the product (all 6 sides), protecting and maintaining its temperature. And because the panels are at the correct temperature, no buffering material is needed, leaving more room for product and simplifying the SOP. Check out the short video here (< 2 min.) to see just how simple the Cool Cube™ system is.

#### Pan-Flu Cache System

This system is ready to respond to an increased demand within a facility and/or at a non-traditional site. The Response-Friendly® approach assures that it has a compact storage footprint, is easily managed, is highly organized and will rapidly deploy.

#### Easy to order. Easy to replace.
Supply management (inventory control) of earmarked preparedness product can be daunting. Is equipment recalled? Are supplies expired? If you have a Response-Friendly® System, use the SmartBook™ inventory file and sort by “Expiration Date” to make sure that your product is up-to-date. Don’t have time? We understand. That’s why we have replenishment packages that range from label-and-ship to on-site service.
