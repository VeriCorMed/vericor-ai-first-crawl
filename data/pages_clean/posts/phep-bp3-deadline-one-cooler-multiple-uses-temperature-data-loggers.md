### B) Temperature Data Loggers
#### For Cold Chain Compliance
The cold chain is about controlling the environment of temperature-sensitive product so that it is in optimal condition when needed. Exposure to any unacceptable condition results in significant problems. That is why the CDC recommends using a specific temperature monitoring device known as a Digital Data Logger (DDL). A DDL continuously monitors the temperature for prevention and records data points for detailed information if excursions happen. VeriCor carries a line of DDLs customers have turned to as simple, affordable solutions.
