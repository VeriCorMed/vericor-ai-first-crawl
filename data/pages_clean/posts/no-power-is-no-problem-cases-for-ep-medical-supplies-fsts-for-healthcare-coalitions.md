### A) No power is no problem!
#### Keep vaccine/blood/pharmaceuticals safe for days.
Power outages create major problems for temperature sensitive product. In late 2016, a South Australian storm led to cold chain breaks of over $400K worth of vaccine. The ability to protect vaccines (or other chilled product) during a blackout is not easy, as the typical medical-grade fridge drifts above 8°C/46°F within a couple of hours after losing power (read more about this topic here). Cool Cube™ PCM coolers not only maintain a tight temperature range for days without ice or electricity, they are safe, easy and ready to transport the product if need be. So if your contingency plan does not involve on a reliable generator, you might as well start considering a Cool Cube™. Watch this short [2-minute video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9G9pjNjopU&feature=youtu.be) to see the simplicity and dependability of the Cool Cube™.
