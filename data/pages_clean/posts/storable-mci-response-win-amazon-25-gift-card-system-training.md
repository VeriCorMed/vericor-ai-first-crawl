#### ACS/ER Systems for Healthcare
A Mass Casualty Incident (MCI) can quickly exhaust the resources of a community.

These mobile solutions come complete, meticulously organized, with the correct equipment/supplies recorded in a detailed inventory list, as a systematically labeled system. Our goal: help your community provide care to the highest numbers of casualties with organized and efficient resources.
