### A) MedKits for Emergency Response
`
 `
#### 13 Prepackaged Care-Specific Medical Kits
`
 `
`
 `More advanced than a first aid kit, VeriCor MedKits contain treatment-specific supplies that are organized within a portable, rolled-up, quick-to-deploy UMO (Upright Medical Organizer…an advanced “jump bag”). In the field, responders see contents within the pockets to facilitate faster treatment. Choose from a wide range of pre-built MedKits ([Airway](https://www.vericormed.com/product/airway-management-medical-kit-module-mk-am/), [Burn Care](https://www.vericormed.com/product/burn-care-medical-kit-module-mk-bc/), [Examination](https://www.vericormed.com/product/examination-medkit-mk-e/), [IV Therapy](https://www.vericormed.com/product/intravenous-therapy-medical-kit-module-mk-it/), [Med Admin](https://www.vericormed.com/product/medication-administration-medical-kit-module-mk-ma/), [PPE](https://www.vericormed.com/product/staff-personal-protective-equipment-medkit-mk-sppe/), [Surgical](https://www.vericormed.com/product/surgical-medical-kit-module-mk-sg/), [Wound Care](https://www.vericormed.com/product/wound-care-medical-kit-module-mk-wc/), and more), or let us customize one tailored to your needs.

### B) A Complete Alternate Care Site System
`
 `
#### Set up in any “building of opportunity.”
`
 `
Every once in a while a healthcare facility needs to expand outside of its walls. This is when an alternate care site gets deployed…maybe into a gym, maybe a superdome. If your emergency preparedness (EP) plan requires such readiness, make sure supplies and equipment are up-to-date, compatible, and mobile. A VeriCor Alternate Care Site System enables you to choose the care functions you want, to then supply you with the equipment and supplies you need. The Response-Friendly® approach ensures an efficient location and setup of resources while making management and upkeep easy. Curious?
