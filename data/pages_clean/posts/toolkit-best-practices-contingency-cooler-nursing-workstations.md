### A) Toolkit Best Practices
#### In case you missed it…
Earlier this year the CDC updated the “Vaccine Storage and Handling Toolkit”. The toolkit outlines the best practices for vaccine storage and handling based on the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) guidelines, product information from vaccine manufacturers, and scientific studies. [Click here](https://www.vericormed.com/whats-been-updated-in-the-2020-cdc-vaccine-vaccine-storage-and-handling-toolkit/) to read an article highlighting the changes that happened earlier this year.

### A) “The” Contingency Cooler – Cool Cube™ 96
#### For times like this.
The Cool Cube™ 96 @ Refrigerated Temps is the ultimate contingency plan cooler:
• Massive space—96 liters (a whole fridge!?).
• Super safe—uses 4.5°C PCM (not 0°C ice).
• No ice/electricity for days—over 5+ days (in use).
• Mobile—wheels for rolling around (& pockets).
Check out its smaller brother, the [Cool Cube™ 28 @ Refrigerated Temps](https://www.vericormed.com/product/cooler-cool-cube-28-vaccine-transport-cooler-at-refrigerated-temperatures-fresh-vaccine-vt-28/) if you don’t need that that has a lot of space itself.

### B) Nursing Workstations with Wheels
#### Roll the supplies into position—then use it as a station.
Vaccination campaigns (or any mobile medical initiative) can involve more supplies than what providers want to drag around. VeriCor workstations give mobility to the load (bulky/heavy supplies) and organization to the plan. From stainless steel partitioned drawers for organization, to glove holders in the lid for accessibility, these workstations are primed and ready for the next mobile campaign.

### C) Medical Kits that are “hangable”
#### Care-specific supplies in a vertical kit.
VeriCor MedKits are organized and ready for field operations. The correct supplies are organized within a portable, rolled-up, quick-to-deploy UMO. In the field, medical personnel can see contents within the pockets to facilitate faster treatment. Back at home, easily manage inventory with the included data-driven SmartBook™.
