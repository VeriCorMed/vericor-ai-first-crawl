### A) Order Now
#### A 2nd wave is expected (& supply chains are still in flux).
With COVID variants taking hold of the nation, another surge of Cool Cube™ ordering is anticipated this fall. In preparation, we have on-order supplies needed to make thousands of VeriCor coolers. But, with supplies and logistics in flux worldwide, we are only able to do so much. 28 & 96 models (the larger sizes) are available right now. 03 & 08 sizes are two and three months out, respectively. Order now to get in line—free cancellation until it ships (which will move others up in line 🙂)!

### A) New Labels = Easier to Use + Enhanced Support
#### On the same great product.
Cool Cube™ PCM panels are now coming to you with a little different look—**new labeling!** Gone are the days of trying to cross-reference alphanumeric characters to determine what goes where. The features of this labeling:
  * Easy-to-understand (& serialized)
  * Color-coded w/ specific holding temperature
  * Size of Cool Cube™ the panel is meant for
  * General pack-out steps (for new staff)
  * Easy to get information (QR code, webpage & phone)

With this rollout, there is a whole **new series of instructional videos** to accompany all the different prep methods of the Cool Cube™:
  * [Fridge Temp (previously “Series 4”)](https://www.vericormed.com/cool-cube-training-videos/#refrigerated-videos)
  * [Lab Freezer Temp (previously “Series 20M”)](https://www.vericormed.com/cool-cube-training-videos/#frozen-videos)
  * [Room Temp (previously “Series 22”)](https://www.vericormed.com/cool-cube-training-videos/#room-temps-videos)

If you haven’t already, watch this [113-second explainer video](https://youtu.be/N9G9pjNjopU) to see the simplicity and effectiveness of Cool Cube™ PCM Coolers.

### C) Emergency Room (ER) System
#### Sets up in minutes.
FSTs (Forward Surgical Teams) are small, mobile surgical units in the United States Army. VeriCor revamped the concept into a mobile emergency room system specifically for emergency preparedness health care coalitions. It supports advanced levels of care typically needed within the “golden hour” of injury during mass causality incidents.
