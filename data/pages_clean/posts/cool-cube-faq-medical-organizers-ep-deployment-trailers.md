### Cool Cube™ FAQ[![Cool Cube™ FAQ](https://www.vericormed.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/cool-cube-faq-300x200.jpg)](https://www.vericormed.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/cool-cube-faq.jpg)
#### Another thing to keep in mind…
**Question:** Is temperature monitoring integrated into the cooler?

**Answer:** No, but it is ready to accommodate your monitor. The fact is a Cool Cube™ PCM cooler is so reliable and so steady, that monitoring the temperature is redundant, especially when using it for less than a day. There are no moving parts, and once it is packed out, really nothing can go wrong…and it will hold a tight temperature range for days! As one customer wrote “it stood up to the test by not deviating even one degree.”

Yet regulations often drive SOPs. That is why all Cool Cube™ models come with features to enable the integration of your calibrated monitor. Outside pockets, cord pass-throughs, and temp card reminders are some of the little details of these unique coolers. But just in case you don’t have a monitor, we have those too.
