#### Protect Staff from Infectious Disease
An infectious disease will pose unique challenges that diminish your healthcare’s response to an emergency. Have ready and waiting prepositioned personal protective equipment (PPE) kits to control the spread of disease and enable the continuity of health care services. Smaller, prepackaged modules ([12](https://www.vericormed.com/product/ebola-ppe-12-kits-ss-evd12/) and [25](https://www.vericormed.com/product/ebola-ppe-25-kits-ss-evd25/) single-use kits) are organized, size-labeled kits within a mobile storage case for quick deployment. The [100](https://www.vericormed.com/product/ebola-ppe-100-ss-evd100/) contact module organizes all PPE into four mobile cases, and includes an inventory management SmartBook™ for easy rotation and handling. Customization options are available.
