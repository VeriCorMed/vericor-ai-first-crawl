# HPP Funding Resources
[one-half-first]Hospitals are a critical element within the medical response system and work collaboratively with other health care providers/agencies to plan, prepare for and respond to the needs of victims of disasters, bioterrorism, and other public health emergencies. Hospitals must respond to increasing preparedness standards and activities, while simultaneously providing effective service to their communities.
_Making sure healthcare organizations have proper Response-Friendly™ equipment and supplies to do so is VeriCor’s goal.[/one-half-first][one-half]_

##### National Guidance for Healthcare System Preparedness (Jan 2012)
In its latest Healthcare Preparedness Capabilities document, ASPR defines healthcare system preparedness as “the ability of a community’s healthcare system to prepare, respond, and recover from incidents.” It then defines and describes eight capabilities, the intent of each, and the expectations for alignment with the Public Health Preparedness Capabilities. You can read the full 73 page document [here](https://www.phe.gov/preparedness/planning/hpp/reports/documents/capabilities.pdf).
