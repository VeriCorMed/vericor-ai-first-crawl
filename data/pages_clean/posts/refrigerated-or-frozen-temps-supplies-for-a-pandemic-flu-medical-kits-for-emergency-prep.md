### A) Refrigerated or Frozen Temps (Dual-Purpose)
#### For vaccine, medicine, blood products, FFP and more.
What’s becoming popular across the country is the utilization of the Cool Cube™ to transport either fresh or frozen vaccine (or blood product). Many health departments (and hospitals) have picked up on the idea of buying an extra set of panels to manage the
“other” temperature as well. All four sizes of Cool Cubes™ have the ability to maintain a [fridge](https://www.vericormed.com/refrigerated-2-to-8c/), [frozen](https://www.vericormed.com/frozen-50-to-15c/) or [room](https://www.vericormed.com/room-15-to-25c-20-to-24c-2/) temperature for days—given the right set of panels are used. So on the next Cool Cube™ order, be sure to add that extra set of panels for maximum transport/back-up flexibility.

### B) When a Replenishment Might be Needed
#### Organized in mobile storage containers.
Be ready for a pandemic influenza outbreak with a VeriCor Pan-Flu Cache System. This system is an organized set of supplies ready to rapidly administer vaccine during an influenza pandemic. The Response-Friendly® methodology assures that despite its small storage footprint, it is easily managed, highly organized and deployable into any building of opportunity. Due to the Coronavirus impact, lead times are currently undetermined (so get in line if at all interested).
