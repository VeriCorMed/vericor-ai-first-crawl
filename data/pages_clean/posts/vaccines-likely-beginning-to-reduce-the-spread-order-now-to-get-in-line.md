### A) Vaccines Likely Beginning to Reduce the Spread
#### L.A. County seeing the evidence.
Many of you are on the front lines working tirelessly to vaccinate those across the country. To those we say “Thank you…keep up the good work!” Research is showing evidence that the increasing COVID-19 vaccinations are beginning to help curb transmission, as reported [here by L.A. County’s KTLA News Channel 5](https://ktla.com/news/local-news/l-a-county-officials-provide-latest-updates-on-covid-19-pandemic/). Know that here at VeriCor we are continuing our efforts to improve the backlog of orders for our coolers so that you can vaccinate more people, with better assurance, sooner!

VeriCor’s line of emergency preparedness beds have a folding design for easy and compact storage while meeting FEMA and ADA compliance standards. But more importantly, they are dependable and comfortable when needed most. All beds ([& racks](https://www.vericormed.com/racks/)) are made with pride right here in the USA.
