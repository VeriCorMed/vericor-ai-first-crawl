### A) Vaccine Safety Made Simple
#### VFC-Compliant Transportation
As you know, the Vaccines for Children (VFC) program offers free vaccines to eligible children, ensuring universal access to essential immunizations. CDC guidelines mandate proper transportation and storage to maintain vaccine efficacy.
Cool Cube™ PCM coolers provide a reliable VFC-compliant solution with phase change material panels that maintain consistent temperatures for over 72 hours—even in extreme conditions. Their interchangeable panels enable precise temperature control across various ranges without electricity, ensuring safe vaccine transport for VFC providers.
