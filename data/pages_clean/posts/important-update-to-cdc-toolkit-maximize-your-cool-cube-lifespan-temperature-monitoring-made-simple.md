### A) Maximize Your Cool Cube™ Lifespan
#### A Quick Inspection Goes a Long Way
The Temp-Shield™ Insulation System is crucial to the Cool Cube’s ability to maintain temperature for 4+ days. If you notice a decrease in performance, inspecting the insulation is essential. A loose skin on the panel indicates a loss of vacuum, possibly due to damage, a puncture, or a leak. This compromises the insulation’s effectiveness, reducing the cooler’s ability to hold temperature.
