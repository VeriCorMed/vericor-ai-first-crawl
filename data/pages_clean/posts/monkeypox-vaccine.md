### A) Monkeypox Vaccine
#### CDC Storage & Handling
The manufacturer initially freezes the monkeypox vaccine (JYNNEOS or ACAM2000), and thawed vaccine must be used within eight weeks of thawing. Know what you are getting, and know what you are doing. The CDC has a 2-page [“Monkeypox Vaccine Storage and Handling Summary](https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/monkeypox/pdf/Storage-and-Handling-Summary.pdf)” PDF you can access [here](https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/monkeypox/pdf/Storage-and-Handling-Summary.pdf).
