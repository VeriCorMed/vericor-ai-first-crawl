### A) A Qualified Container AND Packout
#### It’s something the CDC defines…
The term “qualified container and packout” is mentioned in the toolkit ten times! So in their glossary on [page 28 of the Vaccine Storage and Handling Toolkit](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/admin/storage/toolkit/storage-handling-toolkit.pdf), the CDC defined it: “A type of container and supplies specifically designed for use when packing vaccines for transport. They are ‘qualified’ through laboratory testing under controlled conditions to ensure they achieve and maintain desired temperatures for a set amount of time.”
Now if you are asking yourself “what is that exactly?”, check out VeriCor’s line of Cool Cube™ PCM Coolers. You will get a good idea of why the CDC is pushing this advanced technology. Simply put: NO ice, NO electricity, 4+ days of consistent temperature!

### B) A System for Triage AND Treatment
#### Supplies that can move with responders!
Mass casualty incidences (MCIs) can overwhelm and disrupt a healthcare system…therefore the need for surge preparedness. If it’s hard to imagine what a complete, well-thought-out system looks like, [watch last year’s video of Greater LA VA exercising their Triage & Treatment System](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo_hfT2JOaY).
