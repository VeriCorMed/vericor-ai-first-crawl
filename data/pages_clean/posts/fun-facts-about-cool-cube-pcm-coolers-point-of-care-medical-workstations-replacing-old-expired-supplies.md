### A) Did you know?
#### Fun facts about Cool Cube™ PCM coolers.
  1. The CDC had a picture of the [Cool Cube™ 03](https://www.vericormed.com/product/cool-cube-03-at-fridge-temperatures-vt-03-vaccine-transport-cooler/) on the front of its January 2018 Vaccine Storage & Handling Toolkit. Check out the upper-left picture here.
  2. The [Cool Cube™ 96 @ Refrigerated Temps](https://www.vericormed.com/product/cool-cube-96-vaccine-transport-cooler-at-refrigerated-temperatures-for-fresh-vaccine-vt-96/) (the “big dog”) can hold 134 boxes of vaccine at a lab qualified 2-8°C for 126 hours in a summer profile (71-95°F temps). That’s over 5 days outside during the summer!!!
  3. The shell (case & insulation) of a Cool Cube™ 08 weighs 3 pounds more than an Igloo Playmate® Elite Ultra. So for a tad extra weight you get nearly 5X the performance!
  4. Using just one of the six included phase change technology panels, the [Cool Cube™ 08 @ Refrigerated Temps](https://www.vericormed.com/product/cooler-cool-cube-08-vaccine-transport-cooler-at-refrigerated-temperatures-fresh-vaccine-vt-08/) can hold 2-8°C for 22 hours in a room temperature climate (generally normal working conditions).
  5. The [Cool Cube™ 28](https://www.vericormed.com/product/cooler-cool-cube-28-vaccine-transport-cooler-at-refrigerated-temperatures-fresh-vaccine-vt-28/) & 96 models have a dedicated pocket on the outside of the case, along with a cord port that enables the temperature probe to “pass thru” the case wall.
  6. Cool Cube™ PCM coolers are being utilized in 46 of the 50 states. Hey public health departments in Delaware, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Rhode Island…don’t be the last to get these industry-leading coolers! Customer testimonials are [here.](https://www.vericormed.com/testimonials/)

### C) Point-of-Care Medical Workstations
#### For supply organization and movement.
`
 `
Vaccination campaigns (or any mobile medical initiative) can involve more supplies than what providers want to drag around. These point-of-care workstations give mobility to the load and organization to the plan. Stainless steel partitioned drawers provide ample room for supplies, while convenient glove holders in the lid give accessibility to the necessities. Make it what you want with various sizes, colors and features to choose from.

### C) Replacing Old/Expired Supplies
#### Supply Management Made Easy
Keeping track of earmarked preparedness products can be daunting.
