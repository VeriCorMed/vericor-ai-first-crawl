#### A Question From Your Colleagues
**Question:** “How do I change it from Celsius to Fahrenheit?”

**Answer:** The bottom front cover slides down to reveal the buttons needed on the [TM-6430](https://www.vericormed.com/product/traceable-excursion-trac-temperature-monitoring-data-logger-kit-tm-6430/), [TM-6431](https://www.vericormed.com/product/traceable-excursion-trac-dual-zone-temperature-monitoring-data-logger-kit-tm-6431/), [TM-6440](https://www.vericormed.com/product/traceable-memory-loc-temperature-monitoring-and-data-logger-kit-tm-6440/), [TM-6441](https://www.vericormed.com/product/traceable-memory-loc-dual-zone-temperature-monitoring-data-logger-kit/) models. Feeling foolish? Don’t…many others have missed that as well. Now if you have the TM-4127, that cover does not slide down…the buttons are on back. And if you have the [TM-6500](https://www.vericormed.com/product/traceablelive-dual-zone-temperature-monitoring-data-logger-kit-tm-6500/), of course that is all done via Wi-Fi.

### A “Golden Hour” Solution![FST System for Coalitions](https://www.vericormed.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/FST-System-for-Coalitions-300x200.jpg)
#### FSTs for Healthcare Coalitions
FSTs (Forward Surgical Teams) are small, mobile surgical units in the United States Army. With some rethinking and hard work, VeriCor retooled the FST concept into a system for health care coalitions — the Response-Friendly® Mobile Emergency Room (ER). This system supports advanced levels of care typically needed within the “golden hour” of injury. Be ready when disaster strikes with this complete, efficient and simple patient surge system focused around the emergency room. Curious? Call 866-469-6019 and talk to an experienced staff member today!
