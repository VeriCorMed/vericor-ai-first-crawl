### A) WHO (World Health Organization) Website
#### Advice, tech, research, and more.
If you haven’t visited the World Health Organization’s website lately, glance at it. With advice, technical guidance, response strategies, research, and much more, there is something there that may pique your interest: [WHO Coronavirus Page](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019).

### A) Packed with Relevant Information
#### There’s been great feedback on the new labels.
We implemented a new labeling system for the Cool Cube™ PCM panels a few months ago. Feedback from across the U.S. has been outstanding.
  * The size and temp identifiers are easy to understand.
  * The scannable QR code goes to helpful videos on using it.
  * The simple steps on the label provide direction.
  * The colors are great!

If looking for an extra set, or you require a replacement panel or two, now is the time to buy.
(Many days, we ask ourselves, “why didn’t we do this sooner.”)
If you haven’t already, watch this [113-second explainer video](https://youtu.be/N9G9pjNjopU) to see the simplicity and effectiveness of Cool Cube™ PCM Coolers.

### B) Hospital Triage & Treatment Field System
#### Set up anywhere!
Mass casualty incidences (MCIs) can overwhelm and disrupt a healthcare network if a system is unavailable to expand patient treatment outside traditional walls. VeriCor’s all-in-one Hospital Triage and Treatment System is an intuitive, color-coordinated, mobile system of supplies that provides secondary triage and definitive treatment for a surge of 100 patients. Managers like it because it’s easy to maintain, and responders like it because it can deploy anywhere with the right supplies in the right place quickly. See the system in action ([YouTube video here](https://youtu.be/Xo_hfT2JOaY)) and then call 608-526-6901 to speak with a specialist.

### C) Mobilize and Protect Supplies
#### (Like how all the sports teams do it, but for EP.)
When responders go into the field, medical supplies must be safe, organized, and ready for use. From the compact Upright Medical Organizer ([MC-UMO](https://www.vericormed.com/product/upright-medical-organizer-mc-umo-medical-roll-pack/)) to the rolling Mobile Charging Station ([MC-MCS](https://www.vericormed.com/product/mobile-charging-station-mc-mcs/)), check out VeriCor’s vast array of options. Customization is available.
