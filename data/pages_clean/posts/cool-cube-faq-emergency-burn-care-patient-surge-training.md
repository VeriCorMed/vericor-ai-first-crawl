#### A Question From Your Colleagues
**Question:** “What is the capacity of a Cool Cube™?”

**Answer:** For the size-to-space ratio, it is the best available on the market. We can confidently say that because there is no better insulation (vacuum insulated on all six sides) and no better coolant (PCM panels that are safe to pack product against) available. If a max duration is needed (4+ days / all 6 panels) here are dims of the space to pack product in: Cool Cube™ 03 – 5¾” x 5¾” x 5¾”; Cool Cube™ 08 (pictured) – 11¼” x 6½” x 6½”; Cool Cube™ 28 – 12” x 12” x 12″; Cool Cube™ 96 – 18” x 18” x 18”. If a minimum time is needed (<1 day), only one PCM panel can be used which increases the capacity by 30-113% (depending on model).
