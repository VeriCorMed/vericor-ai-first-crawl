### A) Preparing for the Coronavirus Vaccine
#### Make sure you have good transport and storage coolers.
As a vaccine for the coronavirus comes to fruition, more and more entities are preparing for the transport to, and storage at, PODs (points of dispensing). If you are not 100% confident in your coolers, and the staff’s ability to work with them, look into purchasing some Cool Cubes™ now! VeriCor is ramping up production in anticipation of the vaccine, but order now before the rush.

### A) Cool Cube™ Versatility
#### Change panels—change temperature.
Whether you have Cool Cubes™ at your disposal, or are looking to purchase your first unit(s) this fall, be sure to investigate how easy the coolers can transition from one temperature to another. With just a swap of the panels, the cooler can go from holding fresh vaccine at a cool 5°C fridge temperature to transporting frozen varicella at -21°C. All that is needed is an extra set of panels which you can purchase à la carte. It’s easy. It’s quick.

### B) A Compact Hospital Incident Command System
#### A mobile station for command & control.
Establish command and control with a mobile HICS (Hospital Incident Command System) case. During storage it is out of the way and takes up the space of a desk. But during deployment it transforms into a serious multi-tool with a power management system, table, organizational chart, overhead light, laptop stand, inlay map/document grease board, and numerous drawers and shelves that enable supply organization. Pair it with the [HICS Support Module](https://www.vericormed.com/product/hospital-incident-command-support-module-sm-hics/) (or your own kit) and be ready to respond anytime, anywhere.

### C) PPE Kits for Infection Control & Prevention
#### PPE to help prevent the spread.
As we now are finding out, infectious diseases present unique challenges. VeriCor personal protective equipment (PPE) kits control the spread of a disease by protecting staff and patients with the correct gear. Smaller, prepackaged modules ( [12](https://www.vericormed.com/product/infection-control-and-prevention-ppe-12-kits-ss-icp-ppe12/) and [25 single-use](https://www.vericormed.com/product/infection-control-and-prevention-ppe-25-kits-ss-icp-ppe25/)) are organized, size-labeled kits within a mobile storage case for quick deployment. The [100-contact module](https://www.vericormed.com/product/infection-control-and-prevention-ppe-100-ss-icp-ppe100/) organizes all PPE into four mobile cases, and includes an inventory management SmartBook™ for easy rotation and handling. Next time, be ready with a VeriCor PPE Kit. ***CURRENTLY OUT OF STOCK. Call to be placed on a wait list.***
