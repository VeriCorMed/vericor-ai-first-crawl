### A) Cold Chain Protection
#### Transport cooler, back-up storage, off-site use and more.
In many cases, Cool Cube™ PCM Coolers are purchased to serve a variety of purposes. The first and most obvious use is to transport sensitive product from point A to point B. But then many times, that point B is an off-site clinic at which they use them as temporary fridges or freezers (2nd purpose). And since they work well at holding that specific fridge or freezer temp, the third use is as a back-up fridge or freezer for when the power goes out. One product…so many uses.
Watch this 113-second explainer video to see the simplicity and effectiveness of Cool Cube™ PCM Coolers.

### B) Vaccination System for Mobile Clinics
#### Quickly get off-site clinics up and running.
Save time and streamline fall vaccination campaigns with prepackaged kits from VeriCor. The easy-to-store, simple-to-move, “just add staff & vaccine” kits come in three sizes ([500](https://www.vericormed.com/product/vaccinator-500-go-bag-vaccination-module-vs-500gb/), [2500](https://www.vericormed.com/product/vaccinator-2500-go-system-vaccination-module-vs-2500gs/), [5000-person](https://www.vericormed.com/product/vaccinator-5000-system-with-refrigerator-vaccination-module-vs-5000r/)). The smaller kits are ideal for seasonal clinics, while the larger versions can be stored for pandemic preparedness. Already have the supplies but like the setup? Buy a [Go-Bag](https://www.vericormed.com/product/go-bag-bag/) or [workstation](https://www.vericormed.com/mobile-medical-workstations/) to make your own kit.

### C) Mobile Nursing Station
#### For in-the-field care or off-site clinics.
Vaccination campaigns (or any mobile medical initiative) can involve more supplies than what providers want to drag around. VeriCor workstations give mobility to the load (bulky/heavy supplies) and organization to the plan. From stainless steel partitioned drawers for organization, to glove holders in the lid for accessibility, these workstations are primed and ready for the next mobile campaign.
