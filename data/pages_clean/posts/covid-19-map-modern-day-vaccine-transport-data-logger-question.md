### B) Data Logger Question
#### One probe or two?
VeriCor carries a quality line of digital data loggers (DDLs) thousands of customers turn to for simple, dependable temperature monitoring. When on the phone with customers, a question that often comes up is: “Should I get one probe or two?” The resounding answer is **TWO**. For just $15 more, a second probe gives the option to monitor two zones at once (i.e., ambient temperature; freezer and fridge; two locations in the cooler, etc.). And even if you don’t need two zones, for just $15 more, it gives you a backup probe to use if the first one gets lost or broken.
