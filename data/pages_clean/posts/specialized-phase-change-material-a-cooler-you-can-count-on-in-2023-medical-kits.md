### A) Specialized Phase Change Material (PCM)
#### Engineered to perform at the right temperature!
PCM is excellent for passive temperature control. But the key is to get the correct PCM for the task. PCM at too low of temps (like water/ice) can damage products. PCM with too high of a melting point doesn’t last long enough in the needed zone. Cool Cube™ PCM is perfect for three popular applications: refrigerator, ultra-cold, or room temperature control.[ Visit vericormed.com/pcm](https://www.vericormed.com/pcm/) to learn more

### A) A cooler you can count on in 2023!
#### Reliable—Simple—Mobile
The Cool Cube™ is reliable because physics (thermodynamics) is the only thing at work…no mechanical parts or electricity to fail. The Cool Cube™ is simple since the PCM panels fit in only one way. The Cool Cube™ is mobile as it has ergonomic wheels/handles. Why is it the first choice of health departments and hospitals across the United States? Reliability—Simplicity—Mobility

### C) Mobile Emergency Room (for a patient surge)
#### In any building of opportunity.
FSTs (Forward Surgical Teams) are small, mobile surgical units in the United States Army. They support advanced levels of care typically needed within the “golden hour” of injury during mass causality incidents. VeriCor revamped the concept into a mobile emergency room system for health care coalition preparedness.
