### Why PCM is Popular![Why PCM is Popular](https://www.vericormed.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Why-PCM-is-Popular-300x200.jpg)
#### 3 Facts About Cool Cube™ PCM
1. Cool Cube™ PCM **has a consistent, reliable phase change temperature.** PCM naturally maintains its phase change temperature while melting or freezing. The problem with water is that it has a fixed phase change point at 0°C/32°F, outside the parameters of most temperature sensitive product. Cool Cube™ PCM is engineered to match product temperature requirements. So whether the fridge temp panels @ 4.5°C/40.1°F are used or the frozen temp panels @ -21.5°C/-6.7°F are used, be assured that the Cool Cube™ is maintaining a consistent, reliable temperature.
2. Cool Cube™ PCM **is safe, non-toxic, 100% renewable and readily biodegradable.** Our PCM is produced from agricultural sources, not petroleum. It will fully decompose within months of being introduced into the environment and will not produce long-term negative impacts on the environment. The same cannot be said about other petroleum-based PCM. However, because the PCM will last well over 10,000 cycles, there will be no need to get rid of the panels anytime soon.
3. Cool Cube™ PCM **has a high enthalpy of fusion (it takes a long time to melt).** Each PCM variation (freezer, fridge, and room temp) is able to store more heat per unit volume than conventional storage materials such as water. This allows it to stay longer at its phase change point, ultimately resulting in better performance.

### Triage & Treatment System![A System for MCI Response](https://www.vericormed.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/A-System-for-MCI-Response-300x200.jpg)
#### Efficient. Organized. Effective.
Color-coded mobile cases and care-specific hanging jump bags (UMOs) are the backbone of the VeriCor Triage & Treatment System. This easily managed system is equipped with resources responders use to triage AND treat victims of a mass casualty incident (MCI). The system is efficient, organize and effective on-scene medical care.

#### A Synopsis of Key Changes
The updated version of the National Incident Management System (NIMS) now has a companion guide: [NIMS 2017 Learning Materials.](https://training.fema.gov/nims/docs/nims.2017.instructor%20student%20learning%20materials.pdf) The 52-slide PDF (published by FEMA) provides information to emergency management practitioners on the key changes contained in the [NIMS Third Edition (2017).](https://www.fema.gov/sites/default/files/2020-07/fema_nims_doctrine-2017.pdf) While reviewing the changes, consider a mobile incident command post. This type of platform is used by incident commanders to augment an EOC when needed. VeriCor’s HICS case has many features that include, but are not limited to, a built-in laptop stand, overhead light, an inlay map/document grease board, and two Easyboards®.
