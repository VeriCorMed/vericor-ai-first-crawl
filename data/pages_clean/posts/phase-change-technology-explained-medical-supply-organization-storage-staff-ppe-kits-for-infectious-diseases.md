Hello, medical professionals!
`
 `
Have you heard of “PCM” but don’t know what it is? Section “A” gives you a brief synopsis of the technology and how it relates to temperature sensitive applications. The next two sections deal with cases that can be used to organize medical supplies and handy staff PPE kits to have on hand. As always, have a productive week!

### A) Phase Change Technology Explained
#### What is PCM and how does it work?
The purpose of Cool Cube™ temperature controlled coolers is to maintain an interior thermal environment that meets your product’s requirements. It does so by integrating high performance insulation with passive phase change materials (PCMs).
PCMs change their physical characteristics when absorbing or releasing heat/energy. During this process, they maintain a constant temperature at their “change point”. These materials are not a new concept (water is a PCM that maintains 0°C/32°F during its phase change), but recent advancements in technology have enable customized change points to be engineered for temperature sensitive applications (such as Cool Cubes™).
  * [Cool Cubes™ @ Refrigerated Temps](https://www.vericormed.com/refrigerated-2-to-8c/) utilize PCM with a change point of 4.5°C/40.1°F…ideal for 2-8°C, 1-10°C and similar applications.
  * [Cool Cubes™ @ Frozen Temps](https://www.vericormed.com/frozen-50-to-15c/) utilize PCM with a change point of -21.5°C/-6.7°F…ideal for keeping product such as varicella below -15°C.
  * [Cool Cubes™ @ Room Temps](https://www.vericormed.com/room-15-to-25c-20-to-24c-2/) utilize PCM with a change point of 21.5°C/70.7°F…ideal for keeping drugs and biospecimens at 70°F in a hot car or on a frozen tarmac.

### B) Medical Supply Organization & Storage
#### Tidy up stored equipment and supplies.
When personnel go into the field, it is essential that medical supplies arrive safe, intact and ready for treatment. Secure, mobilize, organize, and protect valuable medical equipment and supplies in storage. From the compact Upright Medical Organizer ([MC-UMO](https://www.vericormed.com/product/upright-medical-organizer-mc-umo-medical-roll-pack/)) to the rolling Mobile Charging Station ([MC-MCS](https://www.vericormed.com/product/mobile-charging-station-mc-mcs/)), checkout VeriCor’s wide array of options. Customization available.

### C) Staff PPE Kits for Infectious Diseases
#### Are you prepared for an outbreak?
An infectious disease will pose unique challenges that diminish your healthcare’s response to an emergency. Have on-hand prepositioned personal protective equipment (PPE) kits to control the spread of disease and enable the continuity of health care services. Smaller, prepackaged modules ([12](https://www.vericormed.com/product/ebola-ppe-12-kits-ss-evd12/) and [25](https://www.vericormed.com/product/ebola-ppe-25-kits-ss-evd25/) single-use kits) are organized, size-labeled kits within a mobile storage case for quick deployment. The [100-contact module](https://www.vericormed.com/product/ebola-ppe-100-ss-evd100/) organizes all PPE into four mobile cases, and includes an inventory management SmartBook™ for easy rotation and handling. Customization options are available.
