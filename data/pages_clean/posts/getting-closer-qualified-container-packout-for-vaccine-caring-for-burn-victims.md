### A) Getting Closer!
#### Pun intended 😅.
In the United States, cases and deaths are at their lowest levels in nearly a year! This is encouraging as anecdotally, it seems like people are getting closer (gathering, traveling, etc.) and resuming normal activities. Credit to you if you are one of the heroes working on getting people vaccinated! Thank you!
Just a reminder that the [CDC COVID-19 home page](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html) contains a wealth of knowledge. Information about vaccines, cases & data (highlighted in the last email), work & school, science, and more. There are also links for individuals, healthcare workers, and health departments. So if you didn’t peruse around last time, check it out by clicking the image or [this link](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html).

### A) Qualified Container & Packout for Vaccine
#### According to CDC Toolkit.
Easy to use phase change material (PCM) panels maintain contents at the desired temperature for an extended period of time. Smaller qualified coolers last 3+ days. Larger qualified coolers last 5+ days. This peace of mind is valuable for transport, backup, and off-site use. Each of the four sizes of coolers can maintain a refrigerated, frozen, or controlled room temperature dependent upon the PCM panel system you use.
If you haven’t already, watch this [113-second explainer video](https://youtu.be/N9G9pjNjopU) to see the simplicity and effectiveness of Cool Cube™ PCM Coolers.
