### A) Covid 19 vaccine distribution plan
#### What does the distribution plan look like?
[In this well-written article publish two days ago by USA Today,](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2020/09/06/covid-vaccine-complex-distribution-supply-chain-follow-approval/5712053002/) Elizabeth Weise gives us a glimpse of what the COVID vaccine rollout might look like. In short, the vaccine will most likely be shipped and stored at an ultra-low temperature until it’s readied for use. Then a tight 2-8°C (36-46°F) will need to be adhered to for up to two weeks—with no wiggle room! Better get those [Cool Cube™ PCM coolers ready…](https://www.vericormed.com/protect/)

### A) Cool Cube™ Versatility – Fridge or Lab Freezer
#### Do both by just switching the panel system.
Within a minute, any of the Cool Cube™ PCM coolers can be transformed from a fridge temperature (5°C) into a lab freezer temperature (-21°C) with a simple swap of the panel system. So if you have one temperature set already, consider purchasing the other for maximum versatility.

### B) Quick & Easy Vaccination Solution
####  Mobilized kits for off-site vaccinations.

The masses are coming! Save time and streamline your upcoming vaccinations with prepackaged kits from VeriCor. The easy-to-store, simple-to-move, “just add staff & vaccine” packages come in three sizes ([500](https://www.vericormed.com/product/vaccinator-500-go-bag-vaccination-module-vs-500gb/), [2500](https://www.vericormed.com/product/vaccinator-2500-go-system-vaccination-module-vs-2500gs/), [5000-person](https://www.vericormed.com/product/vaccinator-5000-system-with-refrigerator-vaccination-module-vs-5000r/)). The smaller kits are ideal for smaller clinics, while the larger “systems” are ready to vaccinate the masses. Already have the supplies but like the setup? Buy a [Go-Bag](https://www.vericormed.com/product/go-bag-bag/) or [workstation](https://www.vericormed.com/mobile-medical-workstations/) to make your own vaccination campaign go-system.

### C) Equipment & Supplies for Patient Care
#### Pan-Flu…COVID-Care?
Be ready for a pandemic influenza outbreak with a VeriCor Pan-Flu Cache System. This system is an organized set of supplies ready to rapidly administer vaccine during an influenza pandemic. The Response-Friendly® methodology assures that despite its small storage footprint, it is easily managed, highly organized and deployable into any building of opportunity. Think this could help with COVID? It’s not ideal, but the new COVID-Care System will (it’s rolling out to a few, select entities). Call 608-526-6901 and request a “COVID-Care consultation” if interested.
