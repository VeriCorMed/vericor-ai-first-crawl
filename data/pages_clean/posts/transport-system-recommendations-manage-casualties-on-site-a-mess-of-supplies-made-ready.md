### C) A Mess of Supplies Made Ready
#### _“VeriCor’s cache conversion process is worth it!”_
Sometimes emergency preparedness supplies don’t get the attention they need in order to be ready for use. Expired, unorganized, damaged, recalled…any number of things can hinder a response for when it is needed most. VeriCor’s Medical Cache Conversion process converts a mess of supplies into a ready-to-respond system that is organized and manageable, so that when an event happens you will be ready.
