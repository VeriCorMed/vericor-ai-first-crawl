#### Self-Contained Carriers w/ Coolant
The common question: “How many gel packs do I need?” Answer: None. Cool Cubes™ already have built-in panels that keep product at a consistent temperature—for days! No other gel packs, ice bottles or electricity needed. They stay cool…they look cool…they have the shape of a cube…that’s why they’re called Cool Cubes™ (okay, the middle size is a prism…but is still cool).

#### We Hope it’s Never Needed Again
Experts say that pandemic influenza outbreaks typically strike 3-4 times a century. Although considerable progress has been made in the last few years, scientists continue to warn us about the risk of not being prepared. Mitigate the risk with a VeriCor Pan-Flu Cache.
