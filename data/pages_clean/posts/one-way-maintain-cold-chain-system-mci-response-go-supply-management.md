### Moving Vaccine & Blood![Safe, Qualified Transport, Not Just for Vaccine](https://www.vericormed.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/cc-300x200.jpg)
#### One Way to Maintain the Cold Chain
When transporting vaccines/blood (for off-site use, temporary relocation, contingency plan activation, etc.), there is one rule…the cold chain must be maintained! When the cold chain is broken, lives are at stake, and at the very least, hundreds of dollars wasted. Don’t leave the cold chain to chance. Use a validated, tested, qualified cooler and pack-out system that thousands have already made the switch to. Once you get it, it’s easy…just add vaccine/blood. (No ice, No electricity, No buffering material.)

### Hospital Triage & Treatment![A System for MCI Response](https://www.vericormed.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/A-System-for-MCI-Response-300x200.jpg)
#### A System for MCI Response
The scene is safe, but now responders to a mass casualty incident (MCI) must analyze the number and severity of patients. This is the ideal time to roll-out organized assets ready for this situation — a VeriCor built, Response-Friendly®, Hospital Triage and Treatment System. Patient treatment will be more effective, efficient and simpler than the DIY alternative.

### Workstations Made Mobile![On-the-Go Supply Management](https://www.vericormed.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/On-the-Go-Supply-Management-300x200.jpg)
#### On-the-Go Supply Management
Vaccination campaigns (or any mobile medical initiative) usually involve more supplies than what providers want to tote around. VeriCor workstations give mobility to the load (bulky/heavy supplies) and organization to the plan. From covers that transform into tables to built-in refrigerators, these workstations have features to support a variety of medical campaigns.
