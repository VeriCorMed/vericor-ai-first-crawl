#### Inspiration for 2022
Goodbye 2021, and welcome 2022! A new year means a new chapter with new challenges. As you embark into the unknown, let Martin Luther King’s words encourage you each step of the way: “You don’t have to see the whole staircase, just take the [next] step.”

### B) Compact and Mobile HICS Station
#### For On-the-Go Command and Control!
Establish command and control with a mobile HICS (Hospital Incident Command System) case. During storage, it can be out of the way and take up the footprint of a desk. But during deployment, it can transform into a serious multi-tool with a power management system, table, organizational chart, overhead light, laptop stand, inlay map/document grease board, and numerous drawers and shelves to enable supply organization. Pair it with the [HICS Support Module](https://www.vericormed.com/product/hospital-incident-command-support-module-sm-hics/) (or your kit), and be ready to respond anytime, anywhere! Learn more by either clicking the picture (or button) or calling 608-526-6901 to talk to experienced VeriCor staff today.

### C) Point-of-Care Workstations for Nurses
#### A mobile unit.
Vaccination campaigns (or any mobile medical initiative) can involve more supplies than providers want to drag around. VeriCor workstations give mobility to the load (bulky/heavy supplies) and organization to the plan. From stainless steel partitioned drawers for organization to glove holders in the lid for accessibility, these workstations are primed and ready for upcoming mobile campaigns!
