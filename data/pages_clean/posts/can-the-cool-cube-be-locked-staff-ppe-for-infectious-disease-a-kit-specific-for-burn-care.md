#### A Question from Your Colleagues
**Question:** Can the Cool Cube™ be locked?

**Answer:** Yes. Locks are not provided with Cool Cube™ PCM coolers due to the differing regulations of various entities. However, quite a few styles and sizes of locks are compatible with the coolers to ensure that valuable product not only stays at the correct temperature, but stays in the cooler as well.

#### Kits Ready to Respond
Infectious disease incidents pose unique challenges that diminish a healthcare community’s response to an emergency. Having prepositioned PPE kits ready to control the spread of disease and enable the continuity of health care services will save lives. VeriCor’s smaller, prepackaged modules (12 and 25 single-use kits) are organized within a mobile storage case for quick deployment. The [100-patient contact module](https://www.vericormed.com/product/ebola-ppe-100-ss-evd100/) integrates all PPE into four mobile cases, and includes an inventory management SmartBook™ for easy rotation and handling. Customization options are available.
