### A) COVID-19: Where to Look for Supplies
#### PPE products in hot demand.
As the coronavirus (COVID-19) continues to advance, the request for personal protective equipment (PPE) is increasing. A decrease in available supply and an increase in demand have suppliers utilizing allocation methods. Unfortunately, as a assembler/manufacturer we are not on the top of the list to get supplies. So due to current demand and limited procurement, VeriCor is not taking orders for [Infection Control and Prevention PPE](https://www.vericormed.com/specialized-response/) at this time. If interested in ordering in the future or to be put on the wait list, email a request to info@vericormed.com.
Currently, your best source to get PPE is through your normal purchasing channels such as a GPO (group purchasing organization). Rationed supplies for businesses like ours come after the front lines (public health, hospitals, etc.) are taken care of. So while we would love to organize the PPE into nice, [Response-Friendly® kits](https://www.vericormed.com/specialized-response/), we will need to wait until this storm passes in order to get you ready for the next—what preparedness is all about.
We will keep monitoring this situation and pass along information as needed.

### A) A CDC Toolkit “Qualified Container & Packout”
#### For 2-8, 1-10, 20-24, & -50 to -15C backup/transport.
Easy to use phase change material (PCM) panels hold contents at the desired temperature for an extended period of time. Smaller qualified coolers last 3+ days. Larger qualified coolers last 5+ days. This peace-of-mind is valuable for transport, backup and off-site use. Each of the four sizes of coolers can maintain a refrigerated, frozen, or controlled room temperature dependent upon the PCM panel system you use. If you haven’t already, watch this [113-second explainer video](https://youtu.be/N9G9pjNjopU) to see the simplicity and effectiveness of Cool Cube™ PCM Coolers.

### B) Hospital Incident Command System Station
#### A compact, mobile workstation for command & control.
Establish command and control with a mobile HICS (Hospital Incident Command System) case. During storage it is out of the way and takes up the space of a desk. But during deployment it transforms into a serious multi-tool with a power management system, table, organizational chart, overhead light, laptop stand, inlay map/document grease board, and numerous drawers and shelves that enable supply organization. Pair it with the [HICS Support Module](https://www.vericormed.com/product/hospital-incident-command-support-module-sm-hics/) (or your own kit) and be ready to respond anytime, anywhere.
