### A) PCM (phase change material)
#### The perfect answer for passive temperature control.
PCM is excellent for passive temperature control. But the key is to get the correct PCM for the task. PCM formulated for too low of temps (like water/ice) can damage products. PCM with too high of a melting point doesn’t last long enough in the needed zone. Cool Cube™ PCM is perfect for three popular applications: refrigerator, ultra-cold, or room temperature control.
