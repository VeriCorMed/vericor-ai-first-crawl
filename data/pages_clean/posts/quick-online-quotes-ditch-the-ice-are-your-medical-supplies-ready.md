### A) Ditch the Ice
#### Precision Temperature Control is Available
Are you still relying on ice packs for your temperature-sensitive shipments? This year, consider upgrading to the precision and reliability of specialized Phase Change Materials (PCMs) to ensure the safety and efficacy of your valuable products.
While ice offers some cooling, it carries the risk of freezing and damaging sensitive materials. Conversely, a cooling method that doesn’t maintain the proper temperature range will result in inconsistent and potentially compromised shipments.
Cool Cube™ PCMs offer a superior solution. Engineered for consistent passive temperature control, they eliminate the risks associated with traditional ice packs.
  * **Refrigerated:** Depending on your needs, maintain critical temperatures between 2-8°C, 1-10°C, or 1-6°C.
  * **Ultra-Cold:** Ensuring temperatures below -15°C for frozen products.
  * **Room Temperature:** Reliably maintaining a stable 15-25°C in the coldest of cold or heat of the sun.

By choosing a specialized PCM with a melting point that matches your specific requirements, you can achieve consistent and reliable temperature stability, safeguarding your vaccines, medications, and other critical supplies.
Say goodbye to ice’s unpredictability and hello to peace of mind. Explore the comprehensive range of Cool Cube™ PCM solutions and find the perfect fit at [vericormed.com/pcm](https://vericormed.com/pcm).
