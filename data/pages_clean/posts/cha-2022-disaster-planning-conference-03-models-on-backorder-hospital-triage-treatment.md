### A) 03 Models on Backorder (again)
#### The 08 is a great alternative!
The demand is crazy for the Cool Cube™ 03 models. As soon as the supply chain catches up, we get overwhelmed again. The good news is all other models are currently in stock and shipping. A great alternative to the Cool Cube™ 03 is the [Cool Cube™ 08](https://www.vericormed.com/product/cooler-cool-cube-08-vaccine-transport-cooler-at-refrigerator-temperatures-fresh-vaccine-vt-08/). With just a touch larger footprint, it carries over twice as much. Order now for those fall initiatives and contingency plans!
If you haven’t already, watch this [113-second explainer video](https://youtu.be/N9G9pjNjopU) to see the simplicity and effectiveness of Cool Cube™ PCM Coolers.

### B) Hospital Triage &Treatment System (Mobile!)
#### Anytime and anywhere.
Mass casualty incidences (MCIs) can overwhelm and disrupt a healthcare network if a system is unavailable to expand patient treatment outside traditional walls. VeriCor’s all-in-one Hospital Triage and Treatment System is an intuitive, color-coordinated, mobile system of supplies that provides secondary triage and definitive treatment for a surge of 100 patients. Managers like it because it’s easy to maintain, and responders like it because it can deploy anywhere with the right supplies in the right place quickly. See the system in action ([YouTube video here](https://youtu.be/Xo_hfT2JOaY)) and then click the picture/button to learn more, or call 608-526-6901 to speak with an experienced VeriCor staff member today.
