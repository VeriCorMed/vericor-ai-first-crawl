### Vaccinations to EP Response
Vaccination campaigns (or any mobile medical initiative) can involve more supplies than what providers want to drag around. VeriCor workstations give mobility to the load (bulky/heavy supplies) and organization to the plan. From stainless steel partitioned drawers for organization, to glove holders in the lid for accessibility, these workstations are primed and ready for the next mobile campaign.

### Cool Cube™ FAQ![The Cool Cube™ Family](https://www.vericormed.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/the-cool-cube-family-300x200.jpg)
#### A Question from Your Colleagues
**Question:** What is the life expectancy of these coolers?

**Answer:** Years and years with simple care.

A telling story…
> We recently used an off-the-shelf cooler for our family road trip, packed-out with food, ice bottles and those soft gel packs found in stores. With 100°F+ temperatures, the insulation had a hard time stopping the heat of parking lots while we enjoyed various attractions…it didn’t last more than that first day. The food up against the bottles of ice initially froze…snacking on those items was hard (pun intended). But the worst part came when we found one of the gel packs had leaked and the gel got on the remaining food…we had to throw it (not knowing what the get was made of). Next time it will be a Cool Cube™!

#### with a Stockpile Ready to Respond
A pandemic influenza outbreak typically strikes 3-4 times a century. Although considerable progress has been made in the last few years to prevent such outbreaks, health care communities still require preparedness supplies. VeriCor’s Pan-Flu Cache system is a methodized set of supplies ready to respond within a facility and/or at a non-traditional site. The Response-Friendly® approach assures that it has a compact storage footprint, is easily managed, is highly organized and will rapidly deploy.
