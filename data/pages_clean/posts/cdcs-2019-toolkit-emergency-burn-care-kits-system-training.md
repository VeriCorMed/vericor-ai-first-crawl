### A) The CDC 2019 Toolkit (newly revised)
#### _If you handle vaccine, this is a MUST READ! _
At the end of last month the CDC published its redesigned Vaccine Storage and Handling Toolkit. Unlike other revisions in the past, this publication was an all-out revamp. New organization, new graphics, and new content! To save you time in your review of the publication, we have published a blog called “[CDC Vaccine Storage & Handling Toolkit 2019 – What changed?](https://www.vericormed.com/cdc-vaccine-storage-handling-toolkit-2019-what-changed/)” for you to skim over and get the basics._(Links to the actual toolkit are in the blog post.)_
If you’ve already read the 49-page toolkit _(good for you for staying on top of things)_ and you need qualified container and pack-out systems or DDLs (digital data loggers) they mention, be sure to visit our new website. We revamped everything too, and now have online purchasing!

### B) Emergency Burn Care Kits
#### _For immediate treatment in the field! _
The Response-Friendly® Burn Care MedKit is a simple, comprehensive kit of supplies intuitively organized into an exclusive, vertical UMO (a roll pack/jump bag that opens up and hangs on a stand). The essential supplies needed for debridement and dressing of burns come intuitively prepackaged in the organizer, which features clear pockets, medical professionals will appreciate. An easy-to-assemble stand and SmartBook™ are also included.

### C) Response-Friendly® System Training
#### _Exercise your staff/supplies/plan!_
If you have a Response-Friendly® System, you already know that it is very intuitive and well put-together. However, if time and resources are scarce and you have training on your 2019 to-do list, give us a call. We have staff that come to you and give the response team a quick training on how to maximize the system. These training packages alleviate the stress and time involved with leading an exercise, and can accommodate almost any budget. From basic how-to management, to full-out MCI scenarios, VeriCor’s team will ensure that you and your staff are ready to respond.
