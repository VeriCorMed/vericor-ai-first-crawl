VeriCor works with our customers to define the capabilities that best suit their response plan, using algorithms to produce a complete list of medical and non-medical equipment to satisfy the desired capabilities. Proprietary software developed by VeriCor computes the quantity of each item by incorporating demand planning factors including operational procedures, standards of care, consumption rates, period of operations and demographics. These calculations are informed by evaluation of demand planning factors, which include:

  * **Operational Procedures:** Ensuring that the inventory supports and enhances established workflows and protocols.
  * **Standards of Care:** Aligning with industry benchmarks and best practices to deliver the highest quality of response.
  * **Consumption Rates:** Accounting for the rate at which supplies are used during operations to prevent shortages or overstocking.
  * **Period of Operations:** Planning for the full duration of the response effort, from initial deployment to demobilization.
  * **Demographics:** Incorporating data on the population being served to ensure culturally competent and effective care.

The Flow-Integration™ process goes beyond mere inventory management. It encompasses a holistic view of response logistics, considering factors such as the physical layout of response sites, the movement of personnel and patients, the transportation of supplies, as well as resupply of assets. This ensures that all elements of the response effort work seamlessly together, reducing inefficiencies and enhancing overall effectiveness.
By integrating these elements into a unified system, VeriCor’s Flow-Integration™ design process empowers organizations to respond to emergencies with confidence and precision. Whether preparing for a natural disaster, a mass casualty event, or a public health crisis, this approach provides the tools and insights necessary to achieve mission success.
