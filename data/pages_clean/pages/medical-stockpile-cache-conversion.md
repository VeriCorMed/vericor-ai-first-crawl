# Cache Conversion
![Cache Conversion header](https://www.vericormed.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Cache-Conversion-header.png)
Health care preparedness is a collaboration between key health care organizations and associations to develop and enhance hospital and other health care entities’ capacity and capability to respond to terrorism, natural disasters and other public health emergencies. Equipment and supply trailers, interoperable communication systems, and medical surge caches are essential.
But what good is a cache if it is not ready to respond? All too often our experts in the field come across a medical cache of cardboard boxes…sometimes damaged, many times expired, and most of the time not response ready. During a public health emergency, having critical equipment and supplies available and ready to dispense rapidly can mean the difference between life and death. Enter in a cache conversion. With our cache conversion process, we do the work and you reap the rewards. We inventory all of your supplies (while checking expiration dates, damage, compatibility, etc.), package them into mobile, durable cases with intuitive organization, label the cases, and provide you with a SmartBook™ to create a Response-Friendly® System so that you can just store it and have it ready to respond. In the end, your valuable medical surge assets are protected, organized, mobile, and sustainable.
Take a look at the information below, but if you are remotely interested in this service be sure to call (608) 526-6901 and ask for a Cache Conversion Service Specialist. Or send an email to info@vericormed.com with your contact information and they will be sure to get back to you.

### **REDUCED FOOTPRINT**  
`  
 ``  
 ``  
 ``  
 ``  
 `
  
This process condenses supplies into stackable medical cases. (Because boxes of all different shapes and sizes take up a lot of unnecessary room.)  

### **INSPECTION OF SUPPLIES** `  
 `
  
A thorough assessment and inspection of all supplies. This prevents adverse patient outcomes due to compromised product.

### **MOBILE MEDICAL CASES**  
`  
 ``  
 ``  
 ``  
 ``  
 `
  
Supplies are organized into portable cases for rapid, easy deployment and recovery. Cases are labeled so that health care providers know the function of the supplies within each case.  

### **INTUITIVE ORGANIZATION**  
`  
 ``  
 `
  
Supplies are packaged with the health care provider in mind. Things are where they should be and are compatible to facilitate efficient care when needed most.
