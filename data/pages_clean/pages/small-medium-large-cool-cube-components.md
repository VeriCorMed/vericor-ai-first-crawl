# Cool Cube™ Additional & Replacement Parts
![Additional-Replacement Parts header](https://www.vericormed.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Additional-Replacement-Parts-header.png)
Additional parts can be purchased to replace lost parts, or to extend the versatility of the Cool Cube™. For example, if you are purchasing an 8 liter VT-08 Vaccine Transport Cooler that is designed for storing vaccine at refrigerated temperatures, you have the option to also purchase frozen panels that will convert your Cool Cube™ to a frozen temperatures vaccine transport cooler, just by changing the panels within the container.
**Cool Cube™ Additional/Replacement Parts**
The technology found in Cool Cubes™ is extensive, but not hard to understand. With just three basic components (case, insulation, PCM), users have the ability to replace parts themselves, enabling a long life and/or a multi-purpose unit.
All Cool Cubes™ have replaceable/interchangeable parts. Click on the Cool Cube™ below for specs and price of size specific components. But if you need help finding the right solution, call (608) 526-6901 or send an email to info@vericormed.com.
