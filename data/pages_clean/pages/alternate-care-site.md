# Alternate Care Site (ACS) System
![Alternate Care Site header](https://www.vericormed.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Alternate-Care-Site-header.png)
An unforeseen incident can overwhelm a healthcare system, and it may even require an expansion of the delivery system to one that includes the role of an alternate care site. An Alternate Care Site (ACS) is a temporary medical system that provides low acuity care during a public health emergency. VeriCor’s ACS System is mobile and robust enough that it can be established near an emergency, or it can expand an existing medical facility in the event of a sudden patient surge. This modular-based system allows customers to build an Alternate Care Site to their own specifications/requirements. The system is swift to mobilize and deploy, intuitively organized so staff can access vital equipment and supplies efficiently, and quick to demobilize at the end of the training exercise or operation.
Take a look at the information below, but if you are remotely interested in this system be sure to call (608) 526-6901 and ask for an ACS System Specialist. Or send an email to info@vericormed.com with your contact information and they will be sure to get back to you.
