An emergency preparedness system is a set of resources that responds to an emergency or disaster. But not all systems are “ready.” VeriCor EP services can help. We have a wide range of options to organize and make sure your system is READY for a successful response, and is able to recover quickly from all hazards. The goal: a Response-Friendly® System that provides better health outcomes for your community during a time of need.
