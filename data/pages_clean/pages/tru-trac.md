### Tru-Trac System™ of Cool Cube™ 28
The Tru-Trac System™ of the Cool Cube™ 28 was born from the desire to enhance mobility and ease of use. This led us to design a custom wheel solution that allows the unit to effortlessly track behind the user, ensuring smooth and stable movement in any environment.
The system features a combination of two fixed wheels and two locking swivel caster wheels, creating an ideal balance between stability and maneuverability. Whether navigating tight indoor spaces or rolling over uneven outdoor surfaces, the Tru-Trac System™ keeps the Cool Cube™ 28 steady and easy to control.
Customers have praised the Tru-Trac System™ for its durability, functionality, and the convenience it brings to their day-to-day operations. From medical professionals transporting sensitive vaccines to disaster response teams transporting life-saving medical supplies, the Tru-Trac System™ ensures that mobility is never a concern.
#### Retrofitting Older Models
For customers with Cool Cube™ 28 units purchased prior to 2017, a retro-fit kit is available to upgrade to the current Tru-Trac System™ of mobility. This retro-fit kit (SKU: CC-CWK) includes everything needed to modernize older units:
**Four heavy-duty caster-style wheels:**
  * Two locking swivel wheels for precise control and stability.
  * Two fixed wheels for straight-line movement and added support.

**Durable mounting hardware** to securely attach the wheels to the Cool Cube™ 28.
The retro-fit kit is specifically designed for older models that originally came equipped with all swivel wheels. By upgrading to the Tru-Trac System™, users can experience the same effortless tracking and mobility as the latest Cool Cube™ 28 units.
