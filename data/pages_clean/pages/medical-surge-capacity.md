Response-Friendly® patient surge systems are mobile and robust enough to be established near an incident or expand to an existing medical facility in the event of a sudden patient surge. In response to a disaster, these complete, organized, mobile systems increase patient capacity quickly and enable healthcare providers to work efficiently. In preparation for, or in the wake of a mass casualty incident (MCI), managers find the sustainable platform extremely helpful.
