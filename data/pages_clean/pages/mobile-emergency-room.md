# Mobile ER System
![Mobile ER header](https://www.vericormed.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Mobile-ER-header.png)
An unforeseen incident can overwhelm a healthcare system, and it may even require an expansion of the delivery system to one that includes the role of a temporary emergency room. A VeriCor Mobile Emergency Room (ER) System is a complete treatment system that provides advanced levels of care during mass casualty incidents and trauma. VeriCor’s ER System is mobile and robust enough that it can be established near an emergency, or it can expand an existing medical facility in the event of a sudden patient surge. This modular-based system allows customers to build a Mobile ER to their own specifications/requirements. The system is swift to mobilize and deploy, intuitively organized so staff can access vital equipment and supplies efficiently, and quick to demobilize at the end of the training exercise or operation.
Take a look at the information below, but if you are remotely interested in this system be sure to call (608) 526-6901 and ask for a Mobile ER System Specialist. Or send an email to info@vericormed.com with your contact information and they will be sure to get back to you.
