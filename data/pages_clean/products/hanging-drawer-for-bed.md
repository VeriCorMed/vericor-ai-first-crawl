# Hanging Drawer for Bed

**Summary:** A hanging pocket for holding small items on response beds. This small accessory is made of the same anti-microbial vinyl used on mattress covers to ensure that it is safe and easy to clean.

The Hanging Drawer for Bed (RB-HD) is a handy pocket for response beds. Attached to the front leg brace of a bed, this accessory is made from the same anti-microbial vinyl that is used in the mattress covers to ensure that it is safe and easy to clean. One large pocket is ideal for a clipboard or other similarly sized objects. One small pocket can be used for a triage flip flag or other small items. Velcro is used for attaching, so additional drawers may be placed on other parts of the bed frame as needed.

### Dimensions & Specs
