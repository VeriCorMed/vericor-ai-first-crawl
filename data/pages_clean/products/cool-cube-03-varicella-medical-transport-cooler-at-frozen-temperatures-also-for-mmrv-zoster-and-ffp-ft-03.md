# Cool Cube™ 03 at Lab Freezer Temps

**Summary:** A laboratory qualified system that utilizes PCM technology to keep product such as varicella, MMRV, zoster or fresh frozen plasma, frozen between -50 and -15°C for 62+ hours without the need for electricity or dry ice. Ideal for extended transportation/storage of valuable frozen product, & to have as a power outage backup.

The Cool Cube™ 03 at Lab Freezer Temps (FT-03) is not an ordinary transport cooler (frozen vaccine and FFP carrier). It is an easy-to-carry, qualified container and pack-out system that keeps temperature sensitive product such as varicella, MMRV, zoster or fresh frozen plasma, frozen between -50 and -15°C for over 2.5 days – without using ice or electricity! This cooler is ideal for transport, but also excels at protecting valuable product during off-site use and power outages, regardless of hot conditions. The simple, validated, patented technology is the best compact thermal protection product available to maintain the cold chain! NOTE: An ultra-low freezer capable of holding a -30°C/-22°F or lower temperature is needed to prep the panels for maximum hold time.

### Technology & Features

 **![](https://www.vericormed.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/green-clipart-circle-1-150x150.png)Phase Change Technology**

Cool Cube™ PCM (phase change material) is engineered to maintain a constant temperature at a specific melt/freeze point. PCM empowers the user with a safe, effective means to maintain the temperature of valuable product.

**![](https://www.vericormed.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/green-clipart-circle-2-150x150.png)Temp-Shield™ Insulation**

Vacuum insulated panels (VIPs) offer advanced thermal protection far superior to other types of insulation. The temperature-holding qualities ensures the user a long-lasting, consistent temperature hold for days.
