# Cool Cube™ 08 at Lab Freezer Temps

**Summary:** A laboratory qualified system that utilizes PCM technology to keep product such as varicella, MMRV, zoster or fresh frozen plasma, frozen between -50 and -15°C for 60+ hours without the need for electricity or dry ice. Ideal for extended transportation/storage of valuable frozen product, & to have as a power outage backup.

The Cool Cube™ 08 at Lab Freezer Temperatures (FT-08) is not an ordinary transport cooler (frozen vaccine and FFP carrier). It is an easy-to-carry, qualified container and pack-out system that keeps temperature sensitive product such as varicella, MMRV, zoster or fresh frozen plasma, frozen between -50 and -15°C for over 2.5 days – without using ice or electricity! This cooler is ideal for transport, but also excels at protecting valuable product during off-site use and power outages, regardless of hot conditions. The simple, validated, patented technology is the best compact thermal protection product available to maintain the cold chain! NOTE: An ultra-low freezer capable of holding a -30°C/-22°F or lower temperature is needed to prep the panels for maximum hold time.

### Technology & Features

 **![](https://www.vericormed.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/green-clipart-circle-1-150x150.png)Phase Change Technology**

Cool Cube™ PCM (phase change material) is engineered to maintain a constant temperature at a specific melt/freeze point. PCM empowers the user with a safe, effective means to maintain the temperature of valuable product.

**![](https://www.vericormed.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/green-clipart-circle-2-150x150.png)Temp-Shield™ Insulation**

Vacuum insulated panels (VIPs) offer advanced thermal protection far superior to other types of insulation. The temperature-holding qualities ensures the user a long-lasting, consistent temperature hold for days.

**![](https://www.vericormed.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/green-clipart-circle-3-150x150.png)Transport Case**

Each outer case is built with mobility in mind. Various features enable the user to move with confidence and know the contents are well protected (and at the correct temperature) during transit and use.
