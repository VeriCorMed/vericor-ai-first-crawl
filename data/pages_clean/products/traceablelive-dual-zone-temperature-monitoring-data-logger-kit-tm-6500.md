# Dual Zone Temperature Monitoring & Data Logger Kit

**Summary:** A data logging thermometer that connects to Wi-Fi and provides continuous data transmission to the cloud-based interface. This highly-accurate thermometer provides remote notification and logging history wherever needed ([subscription required](https://www.traceable.com/traceablelive)).

The Dual Zone Temperature Monitoring & Data Logger Kit (TM-6500) is a data logging thermometer that connects to Wi-Fi and provides continuous data transmission to the cloud-based interface. This highly-accurate thermometer provides remote notification and logging history directly to computers, tablets and/or smartphones ([subscription required](https://www.traceable.com/traceablelive)). Dual glycol filled bottle probes provide accurate temperature readings, ideal for monitoring two temperatures while storing vaccines or other important samples. Audible and visual alarms help to identify any out-of-range conditions. Base unit, probes (2), certificate, flip-open stand, wall mounting, Velcro®, magnetic strips, batteries, and universal adapter included.

### Technology & Features

-

Connects easily to Wi-Fi and provides continuous data transmission to the cloud-based interface.

-

Meets current CDC requirements for vaccine storage and monitoring.

-

Probe bottles (filled with nontoxic GRAS glycol) insulate sensors from momentary temperature changes.

### Additional Features

* TraceableLIVE® app connects to smartphones, tablets and computers. Subscription required.
* Use the app to view current environmental conditions, control your alarm parameters, view your data logging history, run reports, give other team members access, and so much more.

* Probes are sealed in a miniature bottle (1 x 2-1/2 inches) filled with nontoxic glycol and is GRAS (generally recognized as safe) by the FDA (Food and Drug Administration). Bottle insulates sensor from rapid temperature changes when refrigerator door is opened.

### Dimensions & Specs

**Base Unit:** 2¾″ x 6″ x ¾″
**Weight:** 6 oz.
**Temp Range:** -50 to 60°C (-58 to 140°F)

### **SEAMLESS ACCESSORY**

This monitoring device pairs well with a Cool Cube™ PCM cooler. Although the cooler is so consistent and reliable, it is always good practice to keep monitoring temperature sensitive product even when on-the-go.

### **EASY TO USE**

The TraceableLIVE® app (iOS/Android) provides real-time alerts to phones, tablets, emails. Effortlessly view current conditions, control alarm parameters, view data logging history, run reports, give team members access, and so much more.

### **HIGHLY REPUTABLE**

Beginning with spot measuring in 1978, through the evolution of live Wi-Fi today, Traceable® specializes in condition monitoring in various applications (fridges/freezers, storerooms, research, blood banks, coolers, and more).
