# Cool Cube™ 08 at Fridge Temps

**Summary:** A laboratory validated cooler that utilizes PCM technology to keep product such as blood products, tissues, and organs 1-6°C for 53+ hours without the need for electricity, ice or buffering material. Ideal for extended RCB storage (or transportation), field-ops and power outage backup.

The Cool Cube™ 08 at Fridge Temperatures (BT-08) is not an ordinary blood products transport cooler. It is an easy-to-carry, qualified container and pack-out system that keeps temperature sensitive product such as blood products, tissues, and organs chilled between 1° and 10°C for over 3 days, or between 1° and 6°C for over 2 days– without using ice or electricity! This cooler is ideal for transport, but also excels at protecting valuable product during off-site use and power outages, regardless of hot or freezing conditions. The simplified, validated, patented technology is the best compact thermal protection product available to maintain the cold chain!

### Technology & Features

 **![](https://www.vericormed.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/green-clipart-circle-1-150x150.png)Phase Change Technology**

Cool Cube™ PCM (phase change material) is engineered to maintain a constant temperature at a specific melt/freeze point. PCM empowers the user with a safe, effective means to maintain the temperature of valuable product.

**![](https://www.vericormed.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/green-clipart-circle-2-150x150.png)Temp-Shield™ Insulation**

Vacuum insulated panels (VIPs) offer advanced thermal protection far superior to other types of insulation. The temperature-holding qualities ensures the user a long-lasting, consistent temperature hold for days.
