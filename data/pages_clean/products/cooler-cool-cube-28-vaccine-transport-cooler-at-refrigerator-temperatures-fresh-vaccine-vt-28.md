# Cool Cube™ 28 at Refrigerator Temps

**Summary:** A laboratory qualified system that utilizes PCM technology to keep product such as fresh vaccine and medicine safely between 2°C and 8°C for 103+ hours without the need for electricity, ice or buffering material. Ideal for off-site vaccinations, long-term transportation and power outage backup.

The Cool Cube™ 28 at Refrigerator Temperatures (VT-28) is not an ordinary vaccine transport cooler and medicine carrier. It is a lockable, wheeled, qualified container and pack-out system that keeps temperature sensitive product such as fresh vaccine and medicine chilled between 2° and 8°C for over 4 days – without using ice or electricity! This cooler is ideal for transport, but also excels at protecting valuable product during off-site use and power outages, regardless of hot or freezing conditions. The simplified, validated, patented technology is the best compact thermal protection product available to maintain the cold chain!
