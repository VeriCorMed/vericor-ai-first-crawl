# Cool Cube™ 28 at Controlled Room Temps

**Summary:** A laboratory qualified cooler and packout system that utilizes PCM technology to keep product such as FFPE tissue, platelets or biospecimens between 20° to 24°C for 85+ hours, and 15° to 25°C for over 5 days without the need for electricity, ice or buffering material. Ideal for extended transportation/storage of life-saving product.

The Cool Cube™ 28 at Controlled Room Temperatures (RT-28) is not an ordinary transport cooler (FFPE, platelets and biospecimens carrier). It is an easy-to-carry, qualified container and pack-out system that keeps temperature sensitive product such as FFPE tissue, platelets or biospecimens between 20° to 24°C for 85+ hours, and 15° to 25°C for over 5 days – without using ice or electricity! This cooler is ideal for transport, but also excels at protecting valuable product during off-site use and power outages, regardless of hot or freezing conditions. The simple, validated, patented technology is the best compact thermal protection product available to maintain the cold chain!

### Technology & Features

 **![](https://www.vericormed.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/green-clipart-circle-1-150x150.png)Phase Change Technology**

Cool Cube™ PCM (phase change material) is engineered to maintain a constant temperature at a specific melt/freeze point. PCM empowers the user with a safe, effective means to maintain the temperature of valuable product.

**![](https://www.vericormed.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/green-clipart-circle-2-150x150.png)Temp-Shield™ Insulation**

Vacuum insulated panels (VIPs) offer advanced thermal protection far superior to other types of insulation. The temperature-holding qualities ensures the user a long-lasting, consistent temperature hold for days.

**![](https://www.vericormed.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/green-clipart-circle-3-150x150.png)Transport Case**

Each outer case is built with mobility in mind. Various features enable the user to move with confidence and know the contents are well protected (and at the correct temperature) during transit and use.

Additional Features
-------------------

#### PCM Panels

Easy & Safe Pack-Out
--------------------

### **EXTENDED TRANSPORT**

No worries for several days! This validated system will hold 15-25°C (59°-77°F) or 20-24°C (68°-75°F) for an extended time, even in harsh environments. It is long-lasting, passive temperature-controlling technology when you need it most.

### **OFF-SITE INITIATIVES**

Ideal for outreach clinics and field missions! This easy-to-use system eliminates the complicated steps found with other methods, and simplifies/expedites the pack-out process. Packed with mobility features, it can go anywhere it's needed.

### **EMERGENCY BACKUP**

A great solution to keep things safe during power outages! Since it does not rely on ice or electricity, next time the lab incubator goes down have this storage AND transport solution as a backup. Reduce the risk with a Cool Cube™.
