### A) A Grim COVID Milestone
#### 2 1/2 Years – 1,000,000 Deaths
The U.S. death toll from COVID-19 hit 1 million on Monday, May 15th. That’s roughly the number of Americans who died in the Civil War and World War II combined. In recent weeks the mortality rate has slowed. But there is still a lot of work left to eradicate COVID. Thank you to those that are on the front lines! 🙏

### C) Just Add Staff & Vaccine
#### Supplies for vaccinating the masses.
Save time and streamline upcoming vaccinations with prepackaged kits from VeriCor. The easy-to-store, simple-to-move, “just add staff & vaccine” packages come in three sizes ([500](https://www.vericormed.com/product/vaccinator-500-go-bag-vaccination-module-vs-500gb/), [2500](https://www.vericormed.com/product/vaccinator-2500-go-system-vaccination-module-vs-2500gs/), and [5000-person](https://www.vericormed.com/product/vaccinator-5000-system-with-refrigerator-vaccination-module-vs-5000r/)). The smaller kits are ideal for smaller clinics, while the larger “systems” are ready to vaccinate the masses.
Already have the supplies but do you like the setup? Buy a [Go-Bag](https://www.vericormed.com/product/go-bag-bag/) or [workstation](https://www.vericormed.com/mobile-medical-workstations/) to make your vaccination campaign system.
