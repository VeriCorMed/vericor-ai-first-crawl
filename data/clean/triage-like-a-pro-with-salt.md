### A) Facing a Mass Casualty Incident?
#### Triage Like a Pro with SALT
The SALT method is a four-step process that helps manage chaotic situations.
SALT stands for:
  1. **Sort:** Quickly categorize patients based on their mobility.
  2. **Assess:** Evaluate patients’ conditions and administer lifesaving interventions within seconds.
  3. **Lifesaving interventions:** Perform critical actions like stopping severe bleeding or opening airways.
  4. **Treatment/Transport:** Prioritize treatment and transport based on the severity of injuries.

(*One of VeriCor’s mobile surge systems, the [Hospital Triage & Treatment System](https://www.vericormed.com/triage-and-treatment/), can be set up within minutes of an MCI to help responders life-save and treat!)
Mastering SALT can significantly improve patient outcomes in MCIs. For more details on this essential triage method, [check out this article/video on EMS1.com.](https://www.ems1.com/mass-casualty-incidents-mci/articles/how-to-use-salt-to-triage-mci-patients-ioh8pD88282FDTdy/)

### A) The Cool Cube™ Transport Cart
#### Wheel around multiple coolers at once.
Although it is easy enough to sling the Cool Cube™ over the shoulder and go, sometimes wheels would make things a lot easier. Two plus years ago, the Transport Cart got added to the Cool Cube™ line of products—and it’s been a hit ever since!

### B) When Crisis Hits, Be Prepared
#### Discover the Power of Alternative Care Sites
In times of crisis, when the demand for healthcare surpasses the capacity of traditional facilities, Alternative Care Sites (ACSs) emerge as a vital solution. These temporary facilities can significantly expand healthcare capacity and alleviate the strain on hospitals and clinics by repurposing existing structures or deploying mobile units. Our recent blog post, “[Enhancing Emergency Preparedness: Building a Robust Patient Surge Capacity System](https://www.vericormed.com/enhancing-emergency-preparedness-building-a-robust-patient-surge-capacity-system/),” delves into the strategies and best practices for effectively establishing and managing ACSs, ensuring timely and effective care delivery in the face of unprecedented challenges.
To learn more about how our ACS systems can help your organization prepare for and respond to emergencies, visit our website or call us today for a free consultation.
