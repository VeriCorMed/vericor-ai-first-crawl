#### The Ultimate Cooler w/ Pack-Out?
A common question: Can Cool Cubes™ be opened? Answer: Yes. Recently during a 3-day period, a VT-100 was logged as being opened 56 times over the 82 hours it was in a warm, humid room. While it is no surprise to us, product inside the Cool Cube™ 100 at Fridge Temps was still below 8°C…7.77°C to be exact. (The panels were conditioned in a regular 2°C refrigerator in less than 12 hours.) Safe – dependable – lightweight – compact – no ice needed – no electricity needed – easy – usable. It may be the ultimate temperature sensitive cooler and pack-out system on the market!?
