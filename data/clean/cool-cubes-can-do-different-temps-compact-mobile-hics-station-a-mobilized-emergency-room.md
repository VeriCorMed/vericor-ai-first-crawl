### A) Cool Cubes™ can do different temps!
#### One minute they can be a fridge, the next a freezer.
Many customers have discovered the versatility of their Cool Cube™. The easy-to-change PCM panel system enables a cooler to go from a fridge temp of 5°C to a freezer temp of -21°C in the matter of moments. This can be useful in a situation such as a power outage: use it to move flu vaccine to another refrigerator, then swap out the panels and use it to store varicella until the freezer works again. It’s the kind of flexibility that’s appreciated when needed most. Room temperature (22°C) panels also available.

### B) A Compact, Mobile HICS Station
#### A mobile Hospital Incident Command System.
Deploy this station anywhere to establish command and control! (Yet during storage it is out of the way and takes up the space of a desk.) Here’s how it works: the front cover unclips and transforms into a table (an additional work surface); the top lid rotates up to reveal a HICS org chart and overhead light; a laptop stand rises above the inlay map/document grease board work surface to keep technology out of the way but accessible; and the drawers/shelves enable the organization of supplies. Pair it with the [HICS Support Module](https://www.vericormed.com/product/hospital-incident-command-support-module-sm-hics/) (or your own kit) and be ready to respond anytime, anywhere.

### C) A Mobilized Emergency Room
#### A “Golden Hour” Solution for Healthcare Coalitions.
FSTs (Forward Surgical Teams) are small, mobile surgical units in the United States Army. VeriCor has reinvented the concept into something specifically for health care coalitions — the Response-Friendly® Mobile Emergency Room (ER). This system supports advanced levels of care typically needed within the “golden hour” of injury. Be ready when disaster strikes with this complete, efficient and simple patient surge system focused around the emergency room. Curious?
