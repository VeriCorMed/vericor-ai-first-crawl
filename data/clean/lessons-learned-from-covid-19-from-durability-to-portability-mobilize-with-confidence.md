### A) From Durability to Portability
#### How Cool Cubes™ are changing cold chain logistics.
Cool Cube™ PCM coolers have four key advantages over other cooling options.
  1. Cool Cubes™ provide **consistent cooling** as the specialized phase change material melts at a fixed point, ensuring the holding temperature stays the same over time.
  2. Cool Cubes™ are **dependable** and have no moving parts, making them durable and long-lasting.
  3. Cool Cubes™ are **mobile** and come in different sizes, with smaller versions being lightweight and portable, while larger ones have wheels for easy transportation.
  4. Cool Cubes™ are **cost-effective** as they do not require additional equipment, training, or maintenance costs associated with electrical coolers, and you can easily repair them by replacing the damaged part at a lower price.

If you haven’t already, watch this [113-second explainer video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9G9pjNjopU&feature=youtu.be) to see the simplicity and effectiveness of Cool Cube™ PCM Coolers.

### C) Revolutionizing Vaccine Delivery
#### The Rise of Portable Vaccination Systems
Portable vaccination systems have the potential to revolutionize healthcare, particularly in remote and underserved areas where access to vaccines remains a significant challenge. VeriCor’s easy-to-store and simple-to-move vaccination kits, available in three sizes ([500](https://www.vericormed.com/product/vaccinator-500-go-bag-vaccination-module-vs-500gb/), [2500](https://www.vericormed.com/product/vaccinator-2500-go-system-vaccination-module-vs-2500gs/), and [5000-person](https://www.vericormed.com/product/vaccinator-5000-system-with-refrigerator-vaccination-module-vs-5000r/)), can provide vaccine access to thousands, even in the most challenging environments.
