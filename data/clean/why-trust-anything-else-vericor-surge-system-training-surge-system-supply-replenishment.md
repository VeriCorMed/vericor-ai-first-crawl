### A) Back Orders
#### We are working VERY hard on it!
The unprecedented surge of COVID-19 orders has resulted in numerous Cool Cube™ models being in a back-order status. However, we are diligently working with the suppliers of Cool Cube™ parts to get the shipping time back to normal (typically 1-2 days). Thank you for the support and patience…we are proudly doing our little part in providing you (healthcare) the equipment you need during this unprecedented time.

### A) Why trust anything else?
#### Only the best should be used!
As a vaccine for the coronavirus comes to fruition, more and more entities are preparing for the transport to (and storage at) PODS (points of dispensing stations). If you are not 100% confident in your coolers (and the staff’s ability to work with them), look into purchasing some Cool Cubes™ now so that you can be ready for 2021!
If you haven’t already, watch this 113-second explainer video to see the simplicity and effectiveness of Cool Cube™ PCM Coolers.

### B) VeriCor Surge System Training
#### Effective deployment & recovery of VeriCor systems.
By nature, Response-Friendly® Systems (found in all by two states) are intuitive and sustainable. However, if time and resources are scare and a run-through is needed on how to deploy or maintain the system, give us a call. Our staff can give your team a thorough training on how to maximize the system while minimizing your stress and time involved with such exercises. From basic how-to management to full-out disaster scenarios, choose a package that ensures you and your staff are ready to respond. Call (608) 526-6901 today to speak with a training specialist.

### C) Surge System Supply Replenishment
#### Get new supplies for your VeriCor system.
Have hands been digging into that preparedness system for responding to COVID-19? The good news is, if it’s a VeriCor Response-Friendly® System it’s built on a sustainable platform. Let us know the supplies that need to be re-stocked, and we can send you packaged supplies (with location tags) along with a new SmartBook™. If the labor and time would still be too much, we can do a full-service, on-site replenishment. Maybe it hasn’t been touched in a while? Let us do an audit on the system and see what’s expired and give you some options. Call (608) 526-6901 today to speak with a replenishment specialist.
