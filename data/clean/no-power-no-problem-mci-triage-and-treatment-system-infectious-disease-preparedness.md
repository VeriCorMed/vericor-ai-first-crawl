# No Power – No Problem | MCI Triage and Treatment System | Infectious Disease Preparedness
![No Power - No Problem](https://www.vericormed.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/No-Power-No-Problem.jpg)
As some in Western U.S.A. struggle to provide medical care during PSPS (Public Safety Power Shut-offs), the California Department of Public Health wrote up a summary we all could review again regarding vaccine management during power outages: PLAN-PREPARE-RESPOND-RESTORE found [here](https://eziz.org/assets/docs/VFC_Letters/2019/09-26PowerShutOffs.pdf)).
And as always, lots of information can be found on our website.  
Have a productive week!

### A) No Power? No Problem!
#### Keep vaccine, blood and pharmaceuticals safe for days.
Power outages create major problems for temperature sensitive product. Just ask those affected in California right now, or health offices in Southern Australia (a 2016 storm led to cold chain breaks of over $400,000 worth of vaccine). The ability to protect vaccines (or other chilled product) during a blackout is not easy, as the typical medical-grade fridge drifts above 8°C/46°F within a couple of hours after losing power (read more about this topic here). Cool Cube™ PCM coolers not only maintain a tight temperature range for days without ice or electricity, they are safe, easy and ready to transport the product if need be. So if your contingency plan does not involve on a reliable generator, you might as well start considering a Cool Cube™. Watch this [113-second video](https://youtu.be/N9G9pjNjopU) explaining the simplicity and effectiveness of Cool Cube™ PCM Coolers.

### B) MCI Triage & Treatment System
#### Triage and care for casualties anywhere.
Mass casualty incidences (MCIs) can overwhelm and disrupt a healthcare network. Have a system ready to expand patient treatment outside of traditional walls. This all-in-one system is an intuitive, color-coordinated, mobile cache of supplies that provides secondary triage and definitive treatment for a surge of 100 patients. Managers like it because it’s easy to maintain. Responders like it because it can deploy anywhere with the right supplies in the right place.

### C) Infectious Disease Preparedness
#### Kits that will protect staff and patients.
An infectious disease will pose unique challenges that diminish your healthcare’s response to an emergency. Have on-hand prepositioned personal protective equipment (PPE) kits to control the spread of disease and enable the continuity of health care services. Smaller, prepackaged modules ([12](https://www.vericormed.com/product/ebola-ppe-12-kits-ss-evd12/) and [25](https://www.vericormed.com/product/ebola-ppe-25-kits-ss-evd25/) single-use kits) are organized, size-labeled kits within a mobile storage case for quick deployment. The [100-contact module](https://www.vericormed.com/product/ebola-ppe-100-ss-evd100/) organizes all PPE into four mobile cases, and includes an inventory management SmartBook™ for easy rotation and handling. Customization options are available.
