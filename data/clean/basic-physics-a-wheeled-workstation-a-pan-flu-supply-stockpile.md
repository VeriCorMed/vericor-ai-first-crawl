### A) Basic Physics = Reliable & Simple
#### and safe too!
Utilizing some basic physics, the Cool Cube™ is a reliable and simple product. Here’s how…
  * The quality Temp-Shield™ Insulation System delivers long-lasting, non-electric, temperature-holding power. (Physics: the vacuum insulated panels significantly reduce heat transfer compared to every other type of insulation.)
  * A finely tuned temperature system consists of six patented panels containing phase change material (PCM), which are interchangeable and easy to use. (Physics: PCM is engineered to melt WITHIN the temperature parameter, making it a safe, non-electric alternative for temperature sensitive product.)

### B) A Wheeled Workstation
#### _Work smarter, not harder._
Vaccination campaigns (or any mobile medical initiative) can involve a lot of necessities. VeriCor point-of-care workstations provide a wheeled alternative to lugging around a bunch of bulky supplies. Next time, just wheel-it-over, open-it-up, and start providing care. Various sizes, colors and features to choose from!
