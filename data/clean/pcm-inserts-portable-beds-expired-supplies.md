Hello, medical professionals!
Can you believe it’s March!? The impending thawing season (we are in Western WI along the Mississippi River) brings to mind the unique “melting points” of Cool Cube™ PCM coolers…hence the first section. Not interested in the cold chain? The next two sections deal with beds for a surge response and how to replenish a Response-Friendly® System respectively. As always, have a productive week!

### A) PCM Inserts…Take Your Pick
#### _Interchangeable panels dictate the temperature._
Unique panels containing PCM (phase change material) control the temperature of Cool Cube™ coolers. Put in six blue panels and you have a cooler that holds vaccine 2-8°C for 65 hours or blood 1-10°C for 70 hours. Take those out and put in six black panels and the unit will keep varicella between -50°C and -15°C for 62 hours. So while the panels themselves are not multi-purpose (the same panel system CANNOT hold two different temperatures), the Cool Cube™ can be multi-purpose. A complete set of six removable/reusable panels is included with each Cool Cube™, but other sets are available to purchase à la carte. If you haven’t seen what a Cool Cube™ can do for you, watch this quick [2-minute video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9G9pjNjopU&feature=youtu.be).

### B) “Just in Case” Portable Beds
#### _Compact Storage for a Quick Deployment _
When a disaster hits, one the first things needed are beds. It’s what people will turn to for comfort, rest and treatment. The line of beds VeriCor carries meet FEMA guidelines (and ADA compliance standards) while having a folding design for easy and compact storage. But more importantly they are dependable and comfortable for when they will be needed most. All beds and racks are made in the USA.

### C) Replacing Old/Expired Supplies
#### _Supply Management Made Easy_
Supply management (inventory control) of earmarked preparedness product can be daunting.
  * Is equipment recalled?
  * Are products compatible?
  * When do supplies expire?

If you have a Response-Friendly® System those first two questions are taken care of. For the third question you can use your SmartBook™ to monitor upcoming expiration dates.
Now if you don’t have time to do it, we have a service for you! Our proprietary replenishment system significantly cuts down your labor in keeping supplies up-to-date. Our replenishment packages range from label-and-ship to on-site service. Call (866) 469-6019 today to speak with a replenishment specialist.
