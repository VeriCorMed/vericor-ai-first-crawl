### A) What’s Changed?
#### CDC Vaccine Storage and Handling Toolkit Review
Last month (January 11), the CDC published the new “Vaccine Storage and Handling Toolkit.” For those seasoned providers, you’ve seen many versions of the Toolkit throughout the years (including the 2018 revision with an older Cool Cube™, pictured on the cover; find revisions dating back to 2012 here). For those newer to vaccine management, the Toolkit is considered the most comprehensive guide that reflects best practices for vaccine storage and handling throughout the United States.
VeriCor meticulously compared the April 2022 version to this new revision, highlighting their differences. Since things tend to get repositioned in these, movements of words or sections are not noted. But even the slightest word change is. Check out the entire Toolkit with notated changes [HERE](https://files.constantcontact.com/452f8eec701/43f448e4-842a-44a8-840e-5c321b27e6c6.pdf?rdr=true).
**(It is best to view pages as a whole so that the notes are off on the sides.)**

### B) A Service…
#### so you don’t have to.
Most preparedness systems have been ransacked due to the pandemic. If it’s a VeriCor Response-Friendly™ System, the good news is that it’s built on a sustainable platform. Let us know what needs to be re-stocked, and we can send you pre-packaged supplies with location tags and a new SmartBook™. Or our experts can do a full-service, on-site replenishment to save you time and labor. Whatever the case, let us audit the system to see what’s expired and give you some options. Click the picture/button to learn more, or call 608-526-6901 to speak with an experienced VeriCor staff member today.

![A Mess of Supplies Made Ready](https://www.vericormed.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/A-Mess-of-Supplies-Made-Ready.jpg)
### C) We take a mess…
#### and turn it into a Response-Friendly™ System.
Sometimes emergency preparedness supplies are forgotten or not given attention until it is too late. Expired, unorganized, damaged, and recalled assets will hinder a response, and that’s where we can help. Our Medical Cache Conversion process converts a mess of supplies into an organized and manageable ready-to-respond system. Then when a mass causality incident (MCI) happens, you can respond with a Response-Friendly™ system.
