 `PCM absorbs and releases thermal energy during the process of melting and freezing. When solid PCM melts, it absorbs the heat from the environment, yet its temperature stays at the melting point until totally liquid. Conversely, when liquid PCM freezes, it absorbs the cold from the environment yet stays at its temperature until totally solid. Therefore, PCM an ideal, passive solution for a variety of applications that require temperature control. The most common PCM is water, which has a melting point of 0 °C (32 °F). When solid, ice/water maintains a temperature of 0 °C until it turns completely liquid. So, in essence, the 0 °C melting point makes it unsafe for most refrigerated temperature sensitive applications.

Cool Cube™ **Refrigerator Temps PCM** has a melting point of 4.5 °C/40.1 °F. When the PCM is solid, a panel helps the Cool Cube ™stay cool (about 5 °C) in warm/hot environments. When the PCM is liquid, a panel helps the Cool Cube ™stay warm (about 4 °C) in freezing conditions. It’s right around that 4.5 °C/40.1 °F where a PCM panel’s temperature plateaus for a while during the warming up and/or cooling down processes.

### Cool Cube™ Refrigerator PCM – Prep Introduction
#### [Method A](https://www.vericormed.com/cool-cube-training-videos/#fridgeprepa)
### Prep Method A – Keep product cold (in warm conditions)
![Refrigerated Prep A - Freezer-Fridge Prep to keep product cold](https://www.vericormed.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Refrigerated-Prep-A-1.png)
#### Refrigerator PCM Prep Method A: Freezer to Fridge Pack-Out Instructions
**Panel Prep**
**2.1 Lay panels flat in a freezer** until all the PCM (phase change material inside the panel) turns solid. At -15°C/5°F the PCM will solidify in a couple hours.
**2.2 Transfer panels into a fridge** at least 3 hours before use. Panels may be stored in the fridge until needed for assembly or until the PCM melts.*
* If a fridge maintains 4°C/39°F or below, the PCM within the panels will not melt (melting point is 4.5°C/40°F), which will keep the panel solid indefinitely until pack-out. If the fridge maintains 5°C/41°F or above, periodically check for melting and restart at step 2.1 to ensure optimal performance.

![Shake PCM Panel To Check](https://www.vericormed.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Shake-PCM-Panel-To-Check-150x150.png)
**2.3 Shake panels to verify the PCM is solid.** If there is liquid, restart at step 2.1 to ensure the longest hold time. Using liquid PCM or panels with a solid/liquid combination decreases the hold time.

#### [Method B](https://www.vericormed.com/cool-cube-training-videos/#fridgeprepb)
### Prep Method B – Keep product cold (in warm conditions)
![Refrigerated Prep B - Fridge ONLY Prep to keep product cold](https://www.vericormed.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Refrigerated-Prep-B-1.png)
#### Refrigerator PCM Prep Method B: Fridge Only Pack-Out Instructions
**Panel Prep**
**2.1 Lay panels flat in a refrigerator** for a minimum of 24 hours before use.
**2.2 Shake panels** to check the state of the PCM (phase change material inside the panel).
**![Shake PCM Panel To Check](https://www.vericormed.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Shake-PCM-Panel-To-Check-150x150.png)**
  * If liquid…panel is at the fridge temp but above 5°C; anticipate shorter hold times.
  * If solid…panel is at the fridge temp but below 4°C; ideal for maximum hold times.
  * If solid/liquid combination…panel is at the fridge temp of 4-5°C; monitor time/temp.

> In a refrigerator that maintains 4°C or below, the PCM will be solid (ideal for keeping product cold in warm/hot conditions). In a refrigerator that maintains 5°C or above, the PCM will be liquid. Although the PCM is liquid, the panel is at the temperature of the storage environment after 3 hours (i.e., stored in a 6°C fridge, the panels are at 6°C). Assembling the Cool Cube™ with liquid PCM panels (additional thermal mass) will help keep the product at its temperature, just for a shorter amount of time. Monitor Cool Cube™ temperature closely.

### Refrigerator PCM Prep Method D – Prevent freezing (in extreme cold)
![Series 4 - Refrigerated Prep D - Fridge Prep to prevent freezing](https://www.vericormed.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Refrigerated-Prep-D-1.png)
#### Refrigerator PCM Prep Method D: Fridge Only Pack-Out Instructions (to prevent freezing)
**Panel Prep**
**2.1 Place panels in a fridge between 5° and 8°C** for at least 24 hours before use so the PCM (phase change material inside the panel) is liquid.*
* Panels may be stored in the fridge until needed for assembly or the PCM solidifies. If a refrigerator maintains 5°C or above, the PCM within the panels will not get solid (the solidifying point is 4.5°C), keeping the PCM liquid indefinitely until pack-out. Liquid PCM panels will protect the product from freezing until the PCM becomes completely solid.

![Shake PCM Panel To Check](https://www.vericormed.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Shake-PCM-Panel-To-Check-150x150.png)
**2.2 Shake panels to verify the PCM is liquid.** If solid, restart at step 2.1 to ensure the longest hold time. Liquid PCM will prevent the product from freezing (at refrigerator temps) in extreme cold the longest. Using solid PCM or panels with a solid/liquid combination decreases the hold time.

**2.3 Wipe off condensate & shake.**After frost turns to condensate, the panel is above 0°C. Shake panels to verify that the PCM is completely solid. If liquid is heard, re-freeze (Step 2.1) and proceed. Using liquid PCM decreases the hold time considerably.
![asterisk 3](https://www.vericormed.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/asterisk-3.png)
**After Step 3 (before pack-out), insert a thermometer** and close to monitor when the Cool Cube™ gets to the 1°C mark. If below the 1°C mark, wait until it warms up to 1°C before packing out. To speed up the process, transfer panels into a room temperature environment for a couple of minutes and re-check. Pack-out at 1°C will ensure a maximum hold time between 1° and 6°C.

`  
 `
#### Prep Method A: Ultra-Low Freezer Prep to keep product frozen
`  
 `
**Panel Prep**
`  
 `
**2.1 Lay panels flat in an ultra-low freezer until all the PCM (phase change material inside the panel) turns solid. At -30°C/-22°F the PCM will solidify in a day or two.*  
`  
 `**
* If the freezer temperature is ever warmer than -30°C, PCM may not get completely solid (due to the possibility of supercooling). If panels are stored within the temperature parameters of the product but the PCM is liquid, panels may be used but the hold time will decrease.

![Lab Freezer - Prep Method B - Dry Ice-Freezer Prep to keep product frozen](https://www.vericormed.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Lab-Freezer-Prep-B-1.png)
#### Prep Method B: Dry Ice Prep to keep product frozen
**Panel Prep**
**2.1 Pack out cooler with dry ice** until the PCM (phase change material inside the panel) panels become solid. The more dry ice, the faster the PCM will solidify.*
* Time varies dependent on the starting temperature of the panels, size of panels, and amount of dry ice used. CAUTION: Dry ice has a surface temperature of -78.5°C/-109.3°F, so handle with care.

**2.2**(Optional)** If product to be packed out cannot withstand an initial -70°C temperature, **transfer panels into a standard freezer at least 3 hours before use.** Panels may be stored in the freezer until needed for assembly or the PCM melts.**
> If a freezer maintains -23°C or below, the PCM within the panels will not melt (melting point is -21.5°C), keeping the PCM solid indefinitely until pack-out. If the freezer maintains -21.5°C or above, periodically check for melting and restart at step 2.1 to ensure the longest hold time.

#### Prep Method C: Standard Freezer Prep to keep product frozen
**Panel Prep**
**Store panels in a standard freezer (turned down to its lowest setting)** for a minimum of 24 hours before use. Unless the freezer is always below -23°C, the PCM (phase change material inside the panel) will never turn completely solid, but short-term use is still possible.*
* Although PCM is liquid, it is at the temperature of storage environment after 3 hours. For instance, panels stored in a -18°C freezer are at -18°C even PCM is liquid. Assembling the Cool Cube™ with this additional thermal mass will keep product frozen, just for a shorter amount of time than the lab-validated results.

![Shake PCM Panel To Check](https://www.vericormed.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Shake-PCM-Panel-To-Check-150x150.png)

### Prep Method B – Refrigerator (prevent warming)
![Prep Method B - Fridge/Room Prep to keep product cool](https://www.vericormed.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Room-Temps-Prep-B-1.png)
#### Prep Method B: Fridge/Room Prep to keep product cool
**Panel Prep**
**2.1 Lay panels flat in a refrigerator** until all the PCM (phase change material inside the panel) turns solid. At 4°C/39°F the PCM will solidify in a couple hours.
**2.2 Spread panels out (enable airflow to all sides) in a room just before use** to allow the PCM inside to rise to the appropriate operating temperature. Approximate times:
    * “03” size = 35 minutes
    * “08” size = 40 minutes
    * “28” size = 45 minutes
    * “96” size = 50 minutes
**Times based on a 22°C/72°F room.

**2.3 Shake panels to verify the PCM is solid with just a little liquid.** If a little liquid is heard, it is at 21.5°C. If there is a lot of liquid, restart at step 2.1 to ensure the longest hold time. Using liquid PCM or panels with a solid/liquid combination decreases the hold time. Wipe off condensate and proceed with assembly.

#### Prep Method C: Lab Incubator Prep to keep product warm
**Panel Prep**
**2.1 Place panels in a lab incubator 23-24°C** for at least 24 hours before use so the PCM (phase change material inside the panel) is liquid.*
* Panels may be stored in the fridge until needed for assembly or the PCM solidifies. If an incubator maintains 23°C or above, the PCM within the panels will not get solid (the solidifying point is 21.5°C), keeping the PCM liquid indefinitely until pack-out. Liquid panels will protect the product from getting cold until the PCM inside becomes completely solid.

**2.2 Shake panels to verify the PCM is liquid.** If they are solid, restart at step 2.1 to  
ensure the longest hold time. Liquid PCM panels will prevent the product from getting cold (at room temps) in a cold environment the longest. Using solid PCM or panels with a solid/liquid combination decreases the hold time.

#### Prep Method D: Room Prep to keep product warm
**Panel Prep**
**2.1 Place panels in a room between 23-24°C** for at least 24 hours before use so the PCM (phase change material inside the panel) is liquid.*
* Panels may be stored in a room until needed for assembly or the PCM solidifies. If a room maintains 23°C or above, the PCM within the panels will not get solid (the solidifying point is 21.5°C), keeping the PCM liquid indefinitely until pack-out. Liquid panels will protect the product from getting cold until the PCM inside becomes completely solid.

#### [Cool Cube™ 28](https://www.vericormed.com/cool-cube-training-videos/#1637070921845-131f93d2-ad9c)
### Routing a Corded Probe through the Cool Cube™ 28
The Cool Cube™ 28 is equipped with an elastic, external pocket to hold a temperature monitor (or other things) during use. When using a device with a corded probe, here’s how you can do it:
  1. After packing out the product, place the probe in the chamber with the product.
  2. Next, route the cord to the center, front of the Cool Cube™. (If you have not disconnected the cord from the device, do so now.)
  3. Take the plug end of the cord and slide it down between the insulation panel and outer wall of the case about 3” to the black flexible grommet.
  4. Push the plug end of the cord through the flexible grommet (from the inside out).
     * The design allows for the grommet to be removed or possibly popped out during this process. Route the cord through the grommet and re-insert if necessary.
  5. Place the last PCM panel on top to complete the chamber.
  6. Plug the cord into the temperature monitor and place it in the pocket of the Cool Cube™.
  7. Close the lid of the Cool Cube™.

One moment of caution here. Routing a cord through the open lid and not utilizing the grommet hole will likely inhibit the lid from closing completely and could damage or sever the cord when closing the lid.
**Best Practice: Condition the probe to the target temperature before integrating it into the Cool Cube™ chamber.

  1. Slide out the front PCM panel being careful not to disturb the product arrangement.**Be cautious of rings/jewelry on this next step.**
  2. Place the probe within the chamber as if it were the product. Route the cord to the center, front of the Cool Cube™. (If you have not disconnected the cord from the device, do so now.)
  3. Slide a hand between the outer case and front Styrofoam insulation to create about 1” of space, the front vacuum insulated panel will flex slightly.
  4. Take the plug end of the cord and slide it down between the foam and outer wall of the case about 2” to the black flexible grommet.
     * The design allows for the grommet to be removed or possibly popped out during this process. Route the cord through the grommet and re-insert if necessary. 
  5. Push the plug end of the cord through the flexible grommet, from the inside out.
  6. Replace the front PCM panel and place the final panel on top to complete the chamber.
  7. Plug the cord into the temperature monitor and place it in the pocket of the Cool Cube™.
  8. Close the lid of the Cool Cube™.

One moment of caution here. Routing a cord through the open lid and not utilizing the grommet hole will likely inhibit the lid from closing completely and could damage or sever the cord when closing the lid.
**Best Practice: Condition the probe to the target temperature before integrating it into the Cool Cube™ chamber.
