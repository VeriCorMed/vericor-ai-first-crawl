### A) The Last Mile
#### Safeguarding Public Health
Efficient last-mile delivery is critical to vaccine distribution, as it ensures that vaccines reach their intended destination quickly and safely. This process involves moving the vaccine from the storage facility to the location where it will be administered while maintaining the required temperature range to preserve its efficacy. After enduring a potentially long and arduous journey with packaging exposed to varying external temperatures, the last mile is the final stage of vaccine transport. It requires careful planning, coordination, and specialized equipment (such as the Cool Cube™) to ensure that the vaccine is delivered on time and in optimal condition, ultimately safeguarding public health.

### A) Why does the Cool Cube™…
#### keep growing in popularity?
**Temperature Control:** The Cool Cube™ is designed to passively (without electricity or ice) maintain a consistent temperature inside, essential for storing sensitive medical supplies that must be kept at a specific temperature.
**Versatility:** The Cool Cube™ is available in various sizes and configurations, making it suitable for various applications. It can transport refrigerated vaccines, blood products, and other medical supplies, yet with a swap of panels, be a backup to an ultra-low freezer and its contents.
**Portability:** The Cool Cube™ 03 and 08 are lightweight and easy to carry, making them ideal for use in emergencies or when traveling to remote locations. The Cool Cube™ 28 and 96 have a large capacity and are outfitted with wheels, making them ideal for significant initiative and contingency purposes.
**User-Friendly:** The Cool Cube™ is designed with features that make it easy to use and maintain, such as convenient handles, temperature monitor pockets, and intuitive labeling.

### B) Disaster Preparedness
#### The Role of Alternate Care Sites in Healthcare
Alternate care sites (ACSs) are essential to emergency and disaster preparedness in the healthcare industry. During times of crisis (natural disasters, pandemics, or other emergencies), the demand for healthcare services can quickly exceed the available resources. Alternate care sites provide additional patient care areas and beds to alleviate overcrowding in the fixed facilities, ensuring that patients can receive the care they need, even in challenging circumstances. By planning and implementing an ACS as part of a disaster preparedness plan, healthcare organizations can ensure that they are equipped to provide adequate care and protect the health and safety of their patients and staff during times of crisis.
