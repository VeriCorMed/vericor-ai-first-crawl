Emergency Management must be ready to handle many different types of incidents that threaten the health and safety of families, communities, and the nation. Since 2006, VeriCor has worked hard to give EM solutions to their emergency medical needs: MCI systems; incident command systems; jump bag medical kits; storage and distribution of critical medicines and supplies.

Response-Friendly® patient surge systems are mobile and robust enough to be established near an incident or expand to an existing medical facility in the event of a sudden patient surge. In the wake of a disaster, these complete, organized, mobile systems increase patient capacity quickly and enable healthcare providers to work efficiently.
