Cool Cube™ Insulation VIPs are a Very Important Part Some coolers are bulky. Others cannot hold a temperature well. The Cool Cube™ solves both problems. At just 1″ thick, its vacuum insulated panels (VIPs) perform better than 3.3″ of polyurethane — the insulation found in other high performance coolers.
