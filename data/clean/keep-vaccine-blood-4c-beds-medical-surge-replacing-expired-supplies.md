#### Alternative to the DIY Mess
Transporting vaccine/blood/medicine is a necessity that many times ends up being a DIY project. The shopping, testing, validating, training and other headaches associated with figuring out a cooler and pack-out system can be overwhelming, not to mention costly if things go wrong. That’s why we created Cool Cubes™…container and pack-out systems for temperature sensitive product. They’re easy: one quick pack-out for all seasons. They’re qualified: lab validated under ISTA 7D. They’re safe: no ice or electricity, yet lasts for days.
