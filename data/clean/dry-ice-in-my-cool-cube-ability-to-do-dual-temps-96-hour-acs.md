### A) Can I use dry ice in my Cool Cube™?
#### The question everyone is asking…
As it gets nearer to the release of a COVID vaccine, we are getting the dry ice question a lot. The answer is a simple: Yes. The Cool Cube™ will be an excellent cooler for transporting frozen vaccine and dry ice (with whatever panels you use). The dry ice will maintain the cooler, and its contents, at a cool -109.3°F/-78.5°C until it goes through a sublimation process (going directly from a solid into a gaseous form). Once the dry ice is gone, the cooler will then warm up to whatever panels you have in it (refrigerator or lab freezer temp) where it will plateau once again and stay cool that temperature (-20°C for lab freezer or 5°C for refrigerator) until the phase change material (PCM) is melted. Just make sure to follow safe handling procedures for the safe storage, usage, and handling of dry ice.

### A) Four Sizes with the Ability To Do Dual Temps
#### 03 – 08 – 28 -96
The Cool Cube™ numbering system follows suit with the number of liters of pack-out space there is available. The Cool Cube™ 03 is an easy tote to throw over your shoulder. The 08 is a bit larger, but not too much to carry, The Cool Cube™ 28 enters into the “towable” department with wheels and a flip-out pull handle. The 96 is the largest of the Cool Cubes™ and can handle a refrigerator (or freezer) worth of product; again on wheels. And with a quick swap of the panels, every Cool Cube™ can go from holding refrigerator temps to lab freezer temps in an instant.
