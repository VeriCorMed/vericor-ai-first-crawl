### C) EP Response Trailers
#### For Mobile Incident Management
What good are preparedness supplies sitting on pallets in a warehouse 20 miles from where they are really needed? Emergency preparedness response trailers bring EP coordinators both mobility and versatility to their contingency plans. From 18′ single-axle bumper pulls loaded with equipment, to 53′ gooseneck EOCs ready to take command, VeriCor can custom build a trailer with your response scenarios in mind. But be warned…the trailers are not prebuilt skeletons found at your local race track. These are high-quality trailers with EP details in mind (i.e. a higher ceiling for loading equipment, white boards and markers mounted on the walls, load plan maps inside the doors, etc.). The initial customer consult is when the primary mission and secondary capabilities are discussed. Then leave it up to our team to provide you with a trailer that can be exercised and deployed in emergency situations for years to come.
