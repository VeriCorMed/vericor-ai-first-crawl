Eleven-year-old Cool Cube™ PCM coolers are still in the field and transporting valuable temperature-sensitive material (vaccine, blood, varicella, medicine, platelets, etc.). So, with a bit of care and a few helpful tips, you too can expect a long life from your Cool Cube™ PCM cooler.

### A) Temperature Monitoring Device (TMD) “Friendly”
#### The Cool Cube™ Solution to TMD transport.
With storage and handling at the forefront of vaccine distribution these days, it is paramount to keep temperature monitoring devices with the vaccine at all times—including transport. Long ago, VeriCor took these requirements into account when designing Cool Cube™ PCM transport coolers. With integrated pockets and cord management features, these cold chain coolers are ideal for the safety-conscious manager.

### B) “Pro-Tip” for Data Logger Purchasing
#### Re-stocking a preparedness cache can be easy.
Have you ever accidentally broken the temperature probe only to find out that replacement and re-calibration are almost as expensive as the unit itself? You are not the first. That is why we tell a lot of our customers to spend the extra $15 to get the “dual-zone” logger even if they only need one probe. In doing so you will have a backup available in case one probe gets broken. With the cost of shipping the unit in for repair + new probe cost + re-calibration + shipping back…an extra $15 is a good insurance investment. Plus, it gives you the option to monitor two zones at once if ever needed.
