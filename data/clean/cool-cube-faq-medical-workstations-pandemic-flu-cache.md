### A) Cool Cube™ FAQ
#### _A Question From Your Colleagues_
**Question** : “Why choose a Cool Cube™?”
**Answer** : So that vaccine and medicine administered to patients is transported **safely** and is still **effective**. Even the slightest exposure to freezing can damage a vaccine and cause a loss of potency (“freeze damage”). The most common cause of this type of exposure is the failure to correctly condition ice pack used for transport…and it happens all too often. So eliminate those ice packs and simplify the process by using a Cool Cube™. If you haven’t already, watch [this short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9G9pjNjopU&feature=youtu.be) (also linked to the image above) to see the safety and simplicity of the Cool Cube™.

### B) Medical Workstations
#### _Add Mobilization to Supplies_
Vaccination campaigns (or any mobile medical initiative) can involve more supplies than what providers want to drag around. VeriCor workstations give mobility to the load (bulky/heavy supplies) and organization to the plan. From stainless steel partitioned drawers for organization, to glove holders in the lid for accessibility, these workstations are primed and ready for the next mobile campaign.
