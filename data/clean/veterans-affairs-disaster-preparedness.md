# Veterans Affairs Disaster Preparedness
## VeriCor works with many of the largest VAMCs and VISNs around the country.
VeriCor’s Response-Friendly™ products will help you during that next patient surge. In the wake of a disaster or any large-scale incident, VeriCor Response-Friendly™ Patient Surge Systems (ACS & ER) provide the medical and non-medical equipment and supplies, to quickly and efficiently treat patients and protect staff. Currently, our Response-Friendly™ Systems are being exercised at some of the largest VAs in the country. However, we’ve also collaborated with some of you to develop individual products specific to meet the needs of the VA in general. So whether it is a full blown system you want or a simple case to organize your assets, we will help.
