### A) Opening the Cooler During a Clinic
#### Cool Cube™ PCM Coolers are better than most!
During a vaccination clinic, nurses access the supply of vaccine frequently. If kept in a refrigerator, no problem. However if the clinic is off-site, that probably involves opening and closing the portable cooler in which vaccine is stored. So naturally, how does the opening and closing affect the temperature inside the cooler? Unlike a fridge that, when opened, lets cold air escape out the bottom and warm air enter from the top, the Cool Cube™ has a top-open design. When opened, the cool air stays down within the unit while the warm, ambient air stays above it. Once closed, the phase change technology that surrounds the product quickly cools any warm air trapped inside. To corroborate customer testimonies, an opening/closing simulation was run over a 3-day period. During the 82 hours it stayed within the 2-8°C range, the [Cool Cube™ 08 @ Refrigerated Temps](https://www.vericormed.com/product/cooler-cool-cube-08-vaccine-transport-cooler-at-refrigerated-temperatures-fresh-vaccine-vt-08/) was logged as opened 56 times—in a warm, humid environment.

### B) Off-Site Vaccinations
#### Supplies Ready in Mobile Cases 
The DIY model of counting, ordering and organizing all of the supplies needed for upcoming vaccination campaigns is tiresome. Save time and streamline vaccinations with pre-packaged kits by VeriCor. With three primary sizes ([500](https://www.vericormed.com/product/vaccinator-500-go-bag-vaccination-module-vs-500gb/), [2500](https://www.vericormed.com/product/vaccinator-2500-go-system-vaccination-module-vs-2500gs/), [5000-person](https://www.vericormed.com/product/vaccinator-5000-system-with-refrigerator-vaccination-module-vs-5000r/)), these easy-to-store, simple-to-move, “just add staff and vaccine” kits can be used for seasonal off-site clinics or stored for large-scale pandemics. Already have the supplies but like our setup? Get a [workstation](https://www.vericormed.com/mobile-medical-workstations/) to fit your needs (various sizes and configurations available).

### C) Mobile Command & Control
#### From storage to an on-site HICS station in an instant!
In storage it is out of the way and takes up the space of a desk. But deploy this station anywhere to establish command and control. The front cover unclips and transforms into a table (an additional work surface). The top lid rotates up to reveal your HICS org chart and overhead light. A laptop stand rises above the inlay map/document grease board work surface to keep the technology out of the way but accessible. And having both drawers and shelves enables you to organize it the way you want. Pair it with the [HICS Support Module](https://www.vericormed.com/product/hospital-incident-command-support-module-sm-hics/) (or your own kit) and be ready to respond anytime, anywhere.
