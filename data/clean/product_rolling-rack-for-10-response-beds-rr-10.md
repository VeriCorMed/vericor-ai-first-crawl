The Rolling Rack for 10 Response Beds (RR-10) is a rolling storage and deployment rack for 10 Functional Needs Beds or 15 General-Purpose Beds. This rack is constructed of heavy-duty steel with a baked-on, powder-coat finish to protect it from dings and scratches during exercises and/or deployment. Four wheels (two swivel and two fixed) ensure dynamic maneuverability and ease of movement on almost any surface. The rack features a welded-steel construction with laser-cut components for no sharp edges. Let these five shelves support the beds needed for those emergency preparation and mitigation plans.
