![Emergency Preparedness header](https://www.vericormed.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Emergency-Preparedness-header2.png)
When disaster strikes, emergency care must be established in places where normal medical care is unavailable, or a patient surge has maxed out critical patient care capacity. VeriCor specializes in designing and building mobile emergency preparedness systems to established medical support where normal medical care is lacking. Whether it be near an incident or expanding an existing facility in response to a patient surge, temporary medical systems increase patient capacity and enable healthcare providers to render care in the event of a disaster. We build system that are quick and efficient to deploy and are easy for the providers to manage.
**Modularized Systems**
Response-Friendly™ patient surge systems are mobile and robust enough to be established near an incident or expand to an existing medical facility in the event of a sudden patient surge. In the wake of a disaster, these complete, organized, mobile systems increase patient capacity quickly and enable healthcare providers to work efficiently.
