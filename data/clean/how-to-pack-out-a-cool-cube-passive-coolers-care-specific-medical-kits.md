### A) When/How to Pack-Out a Cool Cube™ for Refrigerator Temperatures
#### PDFs and videos are available online.
No matter what type of cooler that is being used, the when and how questions about the pack-out procedures are always abundant. If using ice, layers of buffering material, placement, and timing are all very important to get right. The slightest error decreases vaccine potency (not good for many reasons). If using poorly insulated containers, temperature excursions can happen quickly, resulting in a useless vaccine supply.
With Cool Cube™ PCM coolers, pack-out is dependable and straightforward. In short, **get the PCM panels into a solid-state and then assemble** them into the Cool Cube™ with a temperature monitor. Once in the desired range, pack out the vaccine (or other temperature-sensitive product), and that’s it. In refrigerator temp Cool Cubes™, the holding temperature will level off around an engineered 5 °C until fully melted (as opposed to ice which levels off around 1 °C—out of vaccine temperature parameters). The reason for the temperature leveling off at 5 °C for so long (65+ hours; moving only hundredths of a degree per hour) is the incredible Temp-Shield™ Insulation system of the Cool Cube™. (Plus buffering material is not even needed—the panels are at 5 °C.)
All of the various ways to get Cool Cube™ PCM panels into a solid-state can be found on [this webpage](https://www.vericormed.com/cool-cube-training-videos/) (it has printable PDFs and videos).

### A) Passive Coolers: Off-site to Contingency Purposes
#### Solutions for all your needs!
Cool Cube™ PCM coolers come in four sizes:
  * The “03” is ideal for small payloads going off-site.
  * The “08” holds just enough to still carry over-the-shoulder.
  * The “28” wheels around for more significant initiatives.
  * The “96” fits a whole freezer/fridge worth of vaccine (literally).

All have the same PCM system (for safe temperatures) and insulation system (for long hold times).
