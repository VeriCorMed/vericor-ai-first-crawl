#### Vaccination Supplies Ready-to-Go
The DIY model of counting, ordering and organizing all of the supplies needed for upcoming vaccination campaigns is tiresome. Save time and look more professional with pre-packaged kits by VeriCor. With three primary sizes ([500](https://www.vericormed.com/product/vaccinator-500-go-bag-vaccination-module-vs-500gb/), [2500](https://www.vericormed.com/product/vaccinator-2500-go-system-vaccination-module-vs-2500gs/), [5000-person](https://www.vericormed.com/product/vaccinator-5000-system-with-refrigerator-vaccination-module-vs-5000r/)), these easy-to-store, simple-to-move, “just add staff and vaccine” kits can be used for seasonal off-site clinics or stored for large-scale pandemics. Already have the supplies but like our setup? Get a workstation to fit your needs (various sizes and configurations available).

### Cool Cube™ FAQ![Cool Cube™ FAQ](https://www.vericormed.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/cool-cube-faq-300x200.jpg)
#### A Question From Your Colleagues
**Question:** “At pack-out, how do I know what the temperature is inside the Cool Cube™?”  
  
**Answer:** If you prepped the panels with the cargo, the Cool Cube™ will be at the temperature of the product at pack-out…that is the beauty of this system! Yet if prepped using any of the recommended methods, a fairly tight, consistent temperature within the desired range will be the result. Nonetheless, a digital data logger is recommended to monitor the internal temperature (various models can be purchased separately). All Cool Cubes™ have features that make using a corded monitor easy and convenient. See more about the Cool Cube™ in [this short 2-minute video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9G9pjNjopU&feature=youtu.be)

#### Care-Specific & Mobile![Fully Stocked Medical Kits](https://www.vericormed.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Fully-Stocked-Medical-Kits-300x200.jpg)
More advanced than a first aid kit, VeriCor MedKits contain treatment-specific supplies that are organized within a portable, rolled-up, quick-to-deploy UMO (Upright Medical Organizer…an advanced “jump bag”). When in a pinch, the responding providers have exact locations of the supplies (bag # and pocket) to facilitate a more effective response. Choose from a wide range of pre-built MedKits, or let us customize one tailored to your needs.
