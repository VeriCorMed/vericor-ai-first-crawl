Hello, medical professionals!
Keeping vaccine and other temperature sensitive product safe during a blackout is of utmost importance…hence section “A” regarding cold chain backup. If you are in the EP field, the next two sections deal with patient surge preparedness for mass casualty incidents (MCIs). As always, have a productive week!
_To help you scan topics faster, here are the sections that may interest you…_

### A) The Large Capacity Cool Cube™ 96
#### For backup and contingency planning!
Just over a year ago the cold chain market was introduced to our largest PCM cooler yet…the Cool Cube™ 96. At that time there was no way to predict how popular this portable container with pack-out system would be. Initially this extra-large PCM cooler on wheels was a “made-to-order” product. These days we are stocking the item, yet still find it hard to keep up with demand. Like other Cool Cube™ PCM coolers, it has a user-friendly case for easy mobility and a Temp-Shield™ insulation system for a long-lasting temperature hold. The integrated/interchangeable PCM panels enable safe, dependable temperature configurations for refrigerated, frozen and/or controlled room temperature product. And with its enormous capacity (18″ x 18″ x 18″ of usable space; 96 liters) it is sure to be worth every penny during that next blackout. If you don’t have a backup plan for the thousands of dollars of product sitting in your fridge or freezer, this is for you.

### B) Pick the Care Functions You Need
#### An Alternate Care Site System built just for you! 
Every once in a while a healthcare facility needs to expand outside of its walls. This is when an alternate care site gets deployed…maybe into a gym, maybe a superdome. If your emergency preparedness (EP) plan requires such readiness, make sure supplies and equipment are up-to-date, compatible, and mobile. A VeriCor Alternate Care Site System enables you to choose the care functions you want, to then supply you with the equipment and supplies you need. The Response-Friendly® approach ensures an efficient location and setup of resources while making management and upkeep easy. Curious?

### C) The “Golden Hour” Solution
#### FSTs for Healthcare Coalitions!
FSTs (Forward Surgical Teams) are small, mobile surgical units in the United States Army. VeriCor has reinvented the concept into something specifically designed for health care coalitions — the Response-Friendly® Mobile Emergency Room (ER). This system supports advanced levels of care typically needed within the “golden hour” of injury. Be ready when disaster strikes with this complete, efficient and simple patient surge system focused around the emergency room. Curious?
