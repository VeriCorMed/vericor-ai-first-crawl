[ l What is a PCM panel?  ](https://www.vericormed.com/product/temp-shield-insulation-lid-of-cool-cube-03/)
A **PCM panel** in the Cool Cube is a key component that uses **Phase Change Material (PCM)** to help regulate the temperature inside the unit. These panels are designed to maintain specific temperature ranges crucial for protecting temperature-sensitive items like vaccines, medicines, and biological samples.
Each PCM panel contains a material that melts and solidifies at precise temperatures. As the surrounding temperature increases, the PCM inside the panel absorbs the heat and melts, stabilizing the environment. When the temperature decreases, the PCM solidifies and releases the stored heat, preventing the interior from cooling too rapidly.
In the Cool Cube, there are different types of PCM panels, each indicated by a color-coded tab, designed to maintain different temperature ranges: 
  * **Refrigerator PCM Panels (Blue Tab)** : 2°C to 8°C.
  * **Lab Freezer PCM Panels (Gray Tab)** : -50°C to -15°C.
  * **Room Temperature PCM Panels (Tan Tab)** : 15°C to 25° 

Each Cool Cube comes with 6 PCM panels that make up the PCM System.
[ l What is a VIP System?  ](https://www.vericormed.com/product/temp-shield-insulation-lid-of-cool-cube-03/)
**Answer:**
The **VIP System** , or **Vacuum Insulated Panel System** , is a cutting-edge insulation technology used in Cool Cube products to provide superior thermal protection. VIPs are constructed with a core material surrounded by a vacuum-sealed barrier. This combination offers exceptional insulation, far more efficient than traditional materials like foam or polyurethane. Here’s how it works:
#### 1. Vacuum Insulation:
The vacuum inside the panels minimizes heat transfer by significantly reducing conduction and convection, which are the primary ways heat is transferred. This vacuum environment is key to achieving the high thermal resistance, or R-value, that makes VIPs so effective at keeping heat out and cold in (or vice versa).
#### 2. Efficiency:
VIPs can be up to five times more effective than conventional insulation, meaning they can maintain stable internal temperatures for much longer periods. This is particularly crucial in applications where temperature-sensitive products like vaccines, medicines, or biological samples are being stored or transported.
#### 3. Durability:
VIPs are built to last. The protective outer wrapping around the core helps ensure that the vacuum remains intact, maintaining the panel’s high insulation performance for years. Even after five years, VIPs can retain up to 95% of their original insulating power.
#### 4. Application in Cool Cubes:
In Cool Cubes, the VIP System works in tandem with PCM (Phase Change Material) panels to maintain precise temperature control for long durations, even in extreme conditions. The VIP System is housed within the outer case of the Cool Cube, ensuring that internal temperatures remain stable without relying on electricity or ice.
By utilizing VIP technology, Cool Cubes offer reliable, energy-efficient temperature control for critical applications like medical transport, off-site vaccination efforts, and emergency preparedness.
[ l What is PCM?  ](https://www.vericormed.com/product/temp-shield-insulation-lid-of-cool-cube-03/)
PCM, or **Phase Change Material** , is a type of substance that can store and release large amounts of thermal energy as it changes from one state of matter to another, specifically between solid and liquid phases. This ability to absorb and release heat during its phase transitions makes PCM useful for controlling temperatures.
Here’s how it works: When a material melts (changes from a solid to a liquid), it absorbs heat from its surroundings, which cools down the environment around it. When the material freezes (changes from liquid back to solid), it releases the heat it had absorbed, warming up the environment.
What makes PCM special is that it is engineered to melt and freeze at very specific temperatures, depending on its formulation. For example, some PCM might be designed to melt at a relatively low temperature, like 5°C, while others might melt at higher temperatures. This allows PCM to be used for different applications, like keeping things cool or warm without the need for constant external energy, such as refrigeration.
Because PCM changes phases so efficiently, it can absorb or release a lot of heat without changing its own temperature much during the process. This makes it an excellent tool for maintaining stable temperatures over time, which is critical for safely transporting temperature-sensitive products like vaccines, medicines, and biological samples.
[ l What is a VIP Panel?  ](https://www.vericormed.com/product/temp-shield-insulation-lid-of-cool-cube-03/)
Vacuum Insulation Panel – a form of thermal insulation consisting of a gas-tight enclosure surrounding a rigid core, from which the air has been evacuated.
[ l How does PCM improve cooling efficiency?  ](https://www.vericormed.com/product/temp-shield-insulation-lid-of-cool-cube-03/)
**Answer:**
PCM (Phase Change Material) improves cooling efficiency by leveraging its ability to store and release large amounts of thermal energy during its phase transitions (melting and freezing). Unlike conventional cooling methods, PCM absorbs heat as it changes from solid to liquid, maintaining a stable temperature for longer periods without active refrigeration. When the temperature around the PCM drops, it re-solidifies, releasing the stored energy and continuing to regulate the temperature.
In the Cool Cube product line, PCM helps improve cooling efficiency in the following ways:
  * **Temperature Stability:** PCM maintains a precise, consistent temperature over time, reducing fluctuations that could compromise sensitive materials like vaccines or lab samples.
  * **Energy Efficiency:** By absorbing and releasing thermal energy, PCM minimizes the need for constant refrigeration or energy input, especially during transport, leading to lower energy consumption.
  * **Extended Cooling Duration:** PCM can maintain the desired temperature for a prolonged period, making it ideal for passive cooling solutions during transport or power outages, which improves overall cooling reliability.
  * **Freeze Protection:** PCM prevents the freezing of materials that should remain at above-freezing temperatures, avoiding the risk of damage due to ice or extreme cold.

By using PCM, Cool Cube products ensure that temperature-sensitive materials remain within safe temperature ranges with fewer external cooling interventions, thus increasing the overall efficiency and reliability of the system.
[ l What makes PCM superior to ice?  ](https://www.vericormed.com/product/temp-shield-insulation-lid-of-cool-cube-03/)
**Answer:**
PCM (Phase Change Material) offers several advantages over traditional ice for temperature control, making it a superior choice in applications like the VeriCor Cool Cube. Here’s why:
  * **Precise Temperature Control:**  
Ice maintains a temperature around 0°C (32°F) as it melts, which can be too cold for many temperature-sensitive materials like vaccines and medicines. This can result in accidental freezing, which can ruin the products. PCM, on the other hand, is specifically formulated to maintain a precise temperature. For example: 
    * **Refrigerator PCM** holds temperatures between 2°C and 8°C.
    * **Lab Freezer PCM** holds temperatures around -20°C.
This targeted temperature control prevents freezing (in the case of refrigerator temps) or overheating (in the case of lab freezer temps), ensuring the materials stay within their required temperature range. 
  * **Longer Duration of Stable Temperatures:**  
PCM can maintain a consistent temperature for a longer period than ice. As ice melts, it quickly loses its cooling effectiveness. In contrast, PCM absorbs and releases heat more gradually during its phase change, keeping temperatures stable for extended periods. This makes PCM ideal for transporting materials over long distances or storing them during power outages. 
  * **Energy Efficiency:**  
PCM reduces the need for active refrigeration or the constant replacement of ice packs. It provides a passive, energy-efficient cooling solution. This not only saves energy but also reduces the hassle of constantly replenishing ice, particularly during transport. 
  * **No Risk of Water Damage:**  
When ice melts, it turns into water, which can damage packaging or create messes in storage units. PCM, however, remains self-contained within sealed containers as it changes phases, so there’s no risk of leaks or water damage. This ensures a cleaner, safer environment for sensitive materials. 
  * **Customized Temperature Ranges:**  
PCM can be tailored to specific temperature ranges based on the needs of the products being stored. Ice cannot be customized to maintain temperatures other than around 0°C, making it less versatile. PCM can be used in Cool Cubes for refrigeration, freezing, or even room temperature control, depending on the type of PCM selected. 
  * **Lightweight and Portable:**  
PCM is lighter than carrying large quantities of ice, making Cool Cubes easier to transport. Since PCM is engineered for efficiency, you need less of it compared to the amount of ice you would need for the same cooling effect, which enhances portability.

[ l Can a regular freezer be used to prep refrigerator temperature panels and store panels?  ](https://www.vericormed.com/product/temp-shield-insulation-lid-of-cool-cube-03/)
Yes, for Cool Cubes™ at Fridge Temps. However, before pack-out, the panels must sit out and warm up until they “sweat” so that they don’t make the cooler too cold.
[ l Can a regular refrigerator be used to prep and store refrigerated panels?  ](https://www.vericormed.com/product/temp-shield-insulation-lid-of-cool-cube-03/)
Yes, for Cool Cubes™ at Fridge Temps. Make sure the refrigerator temperature is below 4°C to ensure panels turn solid (the closer the fridge is to 4.5°C, the longer it will take to turn solid).
[ l Can a regular freezer be used to prep and store lab freezer temperature panels?  ](https://www.vericormed.com/product/temp-shield-insulation-lid-of-cool-cube-03/)
Yes, but to get the panels truly hard, the freezer must maintain a temperature lower than -30°C. Otherwise, the panel will be at the temperature of the freezer (in a liquid state) and just won’t last as long.
[ l Can panels be stacked during storage?  ](https://www.vericormed.com/product/temp-shield-insulation-lid-of-cool-cube-03/)
Yes, but they will just take longer to condition (the middle panel will be the last to condition). For the quickest conditioning process, get as much air circulating around the panel as possible. 
> If the panels must be stacked we recommend inserting a spacer (pencil, tongue depressor, etc.) between each panel.
[ l Does the whole Cool Cube™ need to be conditioned?  ](https://www.vericormed.com/product/temp-shield-insulation-lid-of-cool-cube-03/)
No, but the PCM panels need to be prepped.
[ l What does it mean when a panel is liquid?  ](https://www.vericormed.com/product/temp-shield-insulation-lid-of-cool-cube-03/)
The PCM inside is above its phase change temperature.
[ l Should I condition the VIP system?  ](https://www.vericormed.com/product/temp-shield-insulation-lid-of-cool-cube-03/)
No. It is not necessary to condition the vacuum insulated panel (VIP) system. Storage at room temperature is recommended.
