### The Modern-Day Field Hospital
The last MASH (Mobile Army Surgical Hospital) unit was deactivated 11 years ago and converted into a Combat Support Hospital (a team member helped with that conversion/training). Not long after (in 2007), VeriCor developed its first ACS system — a fast and efficient mobile medical system specifically for health care preparedness. This innovative concept was refined to be more complete, yet simpler than its MASH/CSH predecessors. Check out what is now known as a Response-Friendly® Alternate Care Site (ACS) System — the gold standard for patient surge preparedness.

#### FSTs for the Healthcare System
FSTs (Forward Surgical Teams) are small, mobile surgical units in the United States Army. With some rethinking and hard work, VeriCor retooled the FST concept into a system for health care emergency preparedness. VeriCor Mobile Emergency Room (ER) Systems support advanced levels of care typically needed within the “golden hour” of injury. Be ready when disaster strikes with this complete, efficient, and simple Response-Friendly® patient surge system.
