### **Data Logger Specific FAQ**
[ l What is the difference between Excursion-Trac™ and Memory-Loc™?  ](https://www.vericormed.com/product/traceable-memory-loc-temperature-monitoring-and-data-logger-kit-tm-6440/)
**The Excursion-Trac™** is best suited for continuous monitoring with the ability to overwrite old data, making it practical for ongoing use, whereas the **Memory-Loc™** is designed for applications requiring strict data integrity, where data must be preserved and cannot be overwritten.
The **Excursion-Trac™** and **Memory-Loc™** data loggers are both designed for accurate temperature monitoring, but they differ in their data handling, memory capacity, and how they store and manage readings:
#### 1. Excursion-Trac™:
  * The **Excursion-Trac™** data logger is ideal for continuous temperature monitoring and tracking temperature excursions. It records the high and low temperatures at regular intervals (typically every 1 minute) and is capable of storing over **500,000 data points**.
  * One of the key features is that after data has been downloaded to a USB stick, the logger can overwrite old data, making it a practical choice for ongoing monitoring without worrying about memory limits.
  * This model provides a **USB download** option for easy retrieval of data in **CSV format** , and it is particularly useful when monitoring vaccines or other sensitive products in refrigerators or freezers.
  * **Key Feature:** The ability to clear memory after download allows for continuous use.

#### 2. Memory-Loc™:
  * The **Memory-Loc™** logger has a significantly larger storage capacity, capable of storing over **1 million data points**. Unlike the Excursion-Trac, it does **not overwrite old data**. Once the memory is full, it retains the original data, ensuring that no historical records are lost or altered.
  * This model is ideal for applications where data integrity is critical, as the raw data is “locked” and cannot be changed or erased on the base unit. This makes it particularly useful in highly regulated environments where tamper-proof data is required.
  * Similar to the Excursion-Trac, it also provides **USB download** capabilities, but it excels in situations where long-term, unaltered data storage is essential.
  * **Key Feature:** Data is permanently stored on the device, with no option to clear memory, ensuring secure and tamper-proof records.

[ l Why is the data not downloading to a flash drive?  ](https://www.vericormed.com/product/traceable-memory-loc-temperature-monitoring-and-data-logger-kit-tm-6440/)

[ l How long is a calibration certificate good for?  ](https://www.vericormed.com/product/traceable-memory-loc-temperature-monitoring-and-data-logger-kit-tm-6440/)
New units come with a calibration due date of 2 years from the date of manufacture. However, inventorying such products sometimes cuts into this time period weeks or months. We guarantee a calibration due date of at least 1 year past the purchase date.
[ l As Found vs As Left  ](https://www.vericormed.com/product/traceable-memory-loc-temperature-monitoring-and-data-logger-kit-tm-6440/)
When recalibrating your measurement device, you have the option to receive data as “**As Found** “, “**As Left** “, or both.
**AS FOUND** calibration data is calibration data acquired prior to any repairs or adjustments being made to the device. Essentially, it is the condition of the device “as found” when arriving to our facility for calibration. This provides the user an opportunity to ensure that the instrument was reading accurately, and within specification, while it was in use. It offers valuable information and documentation to support an end user’s test results, and it also provides record-keeping on the instrument’s long-term linearity and stability.
**AS LEFT** calibration data is calibration data acquired after any repairs or adjustments are made to the device, i.e. the condition the device was left before shipping back to you. The condition of the device used to acquire the as left data will be the same condition in which you will receive your device.

[ l Duties and Taxes  ](https://www.vericormed.com/product/traceable-memory-loc-temperature-monitoring-and-data-logger-kit-tm-6440/)
Taxes: United States & Canada 
  * Calculated based on delivery location.
  * If $0.00 (Sales tax not collected) is apparent, either VeriCor doesn’t collect sales tax for that state or the order is identified as tax-exempt.
  * If tax-exempt, a valid tax exemption certificate is needed to process the order.

Brokerage: the fee associated with customs clearance for your inbound shipments. 
  * Paid by the “Importer of Record” (customer) based on the value of the shipment to the designated broker.
  * Broker can be identified by the customer prior to shipment (so they use their own), otherwise FedEx will be the default broker.
  * There are ways to avoid broker fees, but there’s time and work involved ([example](https://www.theartofdoingstuff.com/how-to-avoid-broker-fees-just-in-time-for-online-xmas-shopping/)).
