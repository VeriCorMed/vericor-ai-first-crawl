Vaccination season is just around the corner for some of you. A few years ago we published a “Flu Clinic Planning Tips” whitepaper that was wildly popular. Feel free to download that [here](https://www.vericormed.com/?wpfb_dl=164) if you want a last-minute checklist.
And as always, lots of information can be found on the website.  
Have a productive week!

### A) Answer: Easy – Fast – Safe
#### Question: What 3 words sum up the Cool Cube™?
The Cool Cube™ is the easiest, fastest and safest cooler on the market to prep. Easiest because patented PCM panels simplify pack-out. Fastest because there isn’t any buffering material or layering to mess around with. Safest because there’s not any ice to drop the temperature too low.

### B) Kits for Fall Vaccination Campaigns
#### _Systems to quickly get off-site clinics up and running._
Save time and streamline fall vaccination campaigns with prepackaged kits from VeriCor. The easy-to-store, simple-to-move, “just add staff & vaccine” kits come in three sizes ([500](https://www.vericormed.com/product/vaccinator-500-go-bag-vaccination-module-vs-500gb/), [2500](https://www.vericormed.com/product/vaccinator-2500-go-system-vaccination-module-vs-2500gs/), [5000-person](https://www.vericormed.com/product/vaccinator-5000-system-with-refrigerator-vaccination-module-vs-5000r/)). The smaller kits are ideal for seasonal clinics, while the larger versions can be stored for pandemic preparedness. Already have the supplies but like the setup? Buy a [Go-Bag](https://www.vericormed.com/product/go-bag-bag/) or [workstation](https://www.vericormed.com/mobile-medical-workstations/) to make your own kit.
