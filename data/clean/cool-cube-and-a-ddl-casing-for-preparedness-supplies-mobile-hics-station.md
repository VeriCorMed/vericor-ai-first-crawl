111 years ago today, Ford debuted the Model T — the first car for millions of Americans. The automobile has come a long way since then. Ever wonder where cold chain management coolers will be in 100 years? Let’s get there sooner than later!
And as always, lots of information can be found on our website. Have a productive week!

### A) Cool Cube™ & a DDL — a Perfect Pairing
#### Be compliant with a DDL right on the unit!
On page 21 of the [Vaccine Storage and Handling Toolkit](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/admin/storage/toolkit/storage-handling-toolkit.pdf) the CDC states “a portable vaccine storage unit or qualified container and packout may be used with a DDL.”
The problem is pairing your DDL (Digital Data Logger) with any old cooler can be difficult and cumbersome. But not if you have a Cool Cube™ PCM cooler! Integrated pockets and cord-management features allow a seamless integration between a Cool Cube™ and your choice of DDL.

### B) Various Casing Options for Preparedness Supplies
#### Get rid of cardboard boxes to get organized.
When responding personnel go into the field, it is essential that medical supplies are safe, intact and ready for use. From the compact Upright Medical Organizer ([MC-UMO](https://www.vericormed.com/product/upright-medical-organizer-mc-umo-medical-roll-pack/)) to the rolling Mobile Charging Station ([MC-MCS](https://www.vericormed.com/product/mobile-charging-station-mc-mcs/)), checkout VeriCor’s wide array of options.

### C) Mobile HICS Station
#### A compact Hospital Incident Command System.
Establish command and control with a mobile HICS case. During storage it is out of the way and takes up the space of a desk. But during deployment it transforms into a serious multi-tool with a power management system, table, HICS org chart, overhead light, laptop stand, inlay map/document grease board, and numerous drawers and shelves that enable supply organization. Pair it with the [HICS Support Module](https://www.vericormed.com/product/hospital-incident-command-support-module-sm-hics/) (or your own kit) and be ready to respond anytime, anywhere.
