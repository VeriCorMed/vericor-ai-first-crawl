Following a peak in July, Australia is on the back-end of one of its worst flu seasons in recent years. What does that mean for the United States? Time will tell, but [this article found on Healthline.com](https://www.healthline.com/health-news/australia-had-a-horrible-flu-season-what-that-means-for-the-u-s#Preparations-in-the-United-States) talks with some of the experts in the field.

### A) Replace that old vaccine cooler…
#### with the latest in cold chain management!
If an Igloo cooler with ice (or some other poor system) is being used this flu season–REPLACE IT! There is no excuse for vaccine to encounter a freezing temperature or get too warm. Cool Cube™ PCM coolers keep vaccine (or other temperature sensitive product) around 5°C for the entirety of the clinic with ease. Open & closing…fine. Hot conditions…no problem. Prevent future excursions by getting a Cool Cube™.
