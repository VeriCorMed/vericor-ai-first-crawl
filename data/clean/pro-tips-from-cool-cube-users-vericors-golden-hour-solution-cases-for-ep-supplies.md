### A) Pro Tips from Cool Cube™ Users
#### _The best tips of 2018.*_
1. “**Use only one PCM panel.** ” (One of the most popular tips.) The temperature of a Cool Cube™ is determined by the type of phase change material (PCM) used, not the quantity. The _quantity_
2. “**Use tongue depressors to stack panels during storage.** ” Sometimes storage space is limited. Stack PCM panels on top of each other with two tongue depressors (or pencils) in between each layer. This allows air flow around each panel, which will lead to a quicker, more even prep of each panel.
3. “**Use a compact luggage cart to wheel around more than one Cool Cube™ at a time.** ” A dolly such as [this](https://www.vericormed.com/product/cool-cube-transport-cart/) enables one person to wheel around multiple, smaller-sized units such as the[VT-03](https://www.vericormed.com/product/cool-cube-03-at-fridge-temperatures-vt-03-vaccine-transport-cooler/)[VT-08](https://www.vericormed.com/product/cooler-cool-cube-08-vaccine-transport-cooler-at-refrigerated-temperatures-fresh-vaccine-vt-08/). However, you don’t need anything for the two larger Cool Cube™ PCM coolers (the[VT-28](https://www.vericormed.com/product/cooler-cool-cube-28-vaccine-transport-cooler-at-refrigerated-temperatures-fresh-vaccine-vt-28/)[VT-96](https://www.vericormed.com/product/cool-cube-96-vaccine-transport-cooler-at-refrigerated-temperatures-for-fresh-vaccine-vt-96/)) as they have integrated wheels.
4.”**Don’t use any panels.** ” The insulation of the Cool Cube™ is so advanced that sometimes you may not need the PCM panels. The inside of the cooler quickly acclimates to the large mass of conditioned product. Then the Temp-Shield™ insulation does a great job at keeping ambient temperatures at bay.
5. “**Quickly solidify the Series 4 PCM in an ultra-low freezer.** ” Let’s say that you need your Cool Cube™ later in the day, but the PCM panels are sitting in your office, not prepped properly. No problem…they can be ready to use in approximately 90 minutes: put the panels in a -25°C freezer for an hour, and then let them sit out 25 minutes prior to use. It’s a quick way to get the Cool Cube™ ready.
*Test tips out by simulating your methods/applications before actual field use.
