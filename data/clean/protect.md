# Protect the Cold Chain
![Protect the Cold Chain header](https://www.vericormed.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Protect-the-Cold-Chain-header.png)
Keeping cold chain temperature excursions to a minimum is an important task. It affects the safety and efficacy of valuable, life-saving product (vaccine, blood, medicine, etc.). So when the cold chain is dependent on you…make sure it won’t break!
`  
 ``  
 ``  
 `  
Whether needing to store vaccine at an off-site clinic, transport blood in a helicopter, or keep varicella frozen after a power outage, standard coolers and generalized pack-out procedures can be problematic.  
![Cool Cube™ Protects the Cold Chain](https://www.vericormed.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/cc-cca-277x300.png)
  * Accidental freezing of refrigerated product can occur when ice packs or frozen bottles dip the temperature too low.
  * Complicated pack-out procedures can increase human errors that lead to excursions.
  * Lengthy delays or unforeseen temperatures can become too much resulting in out-of-range temperatures.

There is a solution!

 `  
Cool Cube™ PCM Coolers are safe, easy container and pack-out systems for valuable product that hold a consistent temperature for days. 
### **One Cooler — Multiple Uses**
![Protect the Cold Chain - transport blue](https://www.vericormed.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/transport-blue2-166x159.png)
#### Transport
The simple and quick pack-out system of the Cool Cube™ virtually eliminates transport excursions caused by long transits, varying exposures, and/or human error. Born out of shipping industry standards, these validated cooler & pack-out systems have been thoroughly tested and proven over time.

#### Back-Up
Advanced phase change technology keeps product at the desired temperature for days without needing ice or electricity during blackout situations. Every year customers rave about the thousands of dollars of vaccine that was saved because they had a Cool Cube™ as a back-up to their refrigerator or freezer.

#### Off-Site
High thermal-resistant VIPs (Vacuum Insulated Panels) keep the hot/cold outside ambient temperatures at bay for multi-day, off-site use. Because they are portable, compact, and hold a consistent temperature (even with frequent openings), these coolers are ideal for off-site clinic use.
### **Three Temperature Profiles: Frozen, Fridge, Room**
![CC-Panel-Temperature-Configurations](https://www.vericormed.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CC-Panel-Temperature-Configurations.png)
The internal temperature of the Cool Cube™ is controlled by easy-to-prep panels containing phase change material (PCM). Panels assemble quickly to form a chamber ready for pack-out…at a temperature that is nearly identical to the product. It’s simple (minimal steps) and safe (no buffering material needed).
#### Lab Freezer Temps
## -50° to -15°C
When a ultra-low temperature is needed, Lab Freezer PCM panels (grey) will keep product frozen for days. This dry-ice alternative is far safer and more effective than dry-ice. The advanced phase change technology allows these panels to hover around -21.5°C (-6.7°F) for a long period of time. As a result, product getting too cold or too warm is eliminated and no need for bulky buffering material.

#### Refrigerator Temps
## 2-8°C | 1-10°C | 1-6°C
When a refrigerated temperature range is needed, Refrigerator PCM panels (blue) are at the sweet spot of freshness. This ice alternative is far safer and more effective than ice packs. The advanced phase change technology allows these panels to hover around 4.5°C (40.1°F) for a long period of time. As a result, accidental freezing is eliminated as well as the need for bulky buffering material (the coolant is at 4.5°C).

#### Room Temps
## 15°-25°C | 20°-24°C
When a controlled room temperature range is needed, Room Temp PCM panels (tan) will keep product at a warm temperature for days, despite being in a cold or hot environment. This ice alternative is far safer and more effective than ice packs. The advanced phase change technology allows these panels to hover around 21.5°C (70.7°F) for a long period of time. There is no need for bulky buffering material.

 `  
At just a bit larger than a lunchbox, the Cool Cube™ 03, is compact enough to tote around, yet big enough for the basics. When using six PCM panels (for maximum duration), the usable space is just under 6” x 6” x 6”. Need more space? Use fewer panels to gain usable area (realizing the in-parameter time duration will be less). A carrying handle, shoulder strap, 5 outside pockets (clear), and a double zipper all create a user-friendly experience. Need to carry a temperature monitor with the product? This Cool Cube™ has that solved with pockets on the outside to hold the monitor and a dual-zipper to go around the cord going into the inside.
