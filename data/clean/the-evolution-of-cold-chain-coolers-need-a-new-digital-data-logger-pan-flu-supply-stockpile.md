Hello, medical professionals!
Methods used to transport temperature sensitive product are evolving quickly. Read Section “A” for the latest in cold chain management practices. Section “B” is for those needing a good DDL (digital data logger). The last section (“C”) highlights a system of supplies ready to deploy at the first signs of an influenza outbreak. As always, have a productive week!
_To help you scan topics faster, here are the sections that may interest you…_

### A) The Evolution of Cold Chain Coolers
#### Are outdated methods being used?
If using water/ice to keep vaccine cold during transport, you are using square wheels! Here is a quick evolution of the vaccine cooler…
  * A long time ago, ice in styrofoam coolers kept vaccine cold — but a little too cold. When freezing problems got exposed (cold chain breaks), this method was ditched.
  * Then came the conditioning of ice bottles in hard-sided coolers. The problems? Temps still dropped below the minimum 2°C/35.6°F, warm & cold spots were found throughout the cooler, and a lengthy/complex SOP was required.
  * More recent solutions have been portable electrical units. But these are bulky &
  * heavy, corded, and required frequent maintenance.
  * Nowadays, phase-change material (PCM) is taking over. Although still a bit expensive, a 10-day hold time is possible if combined with good insulation (at least in the case of a Cool Cube™).

Cool Cube™ PCM coolers combines the safety of PCM technology (phase change material) with the protection of VIPs (vacuum insulation panels) to reliably transport temperature sensitive product. These coolers/transporters are made specifically to maintain the cold chain with ease and simplicity. Replace those square wheels (ice/water) with round wheels (PCM/VIPs)…you will be amazed!

### B) Need a new Digital Data Logger (DDL)?
#### Here is some assistance to help you choose…
PROOF. Plain and simple, proof is what they will need in a possible cold chain break. A lot of states are now requiring digital proof of temperatures to be kept 3 years or more. If you need a new DDL or are looking to upgrade, check out this interactive chart to figure out the best model for your needs.

### C) Pan Flu Supply Stockpile
#### A Response-Friendly™ system of supplies.
A pandemic influenza outbreak typically strikes 3-4 times a century. Although considerable progress has been made in the last few years to prevent such outbreaks, health care communities still require preparedness supplies. VeriCor’s Pan-Flu Cache system is a methodized set of supplies ready to respond within a facility and/or at a non-traditional site. The Response-Friendly® approach assures that it has a compact storage footprint, is easily managed, is highly organized and rapidly deploys.
