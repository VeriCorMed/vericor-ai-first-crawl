### A) From Space to Your Clinic
#### Cutting-Edge Technology for the Cold Chain!
Critical points for choosing vaccine carriers:
  1. **PCM (the coolant)**
     * Unlike ice packs or frozen blocks, Cool Cube™ PCM has a targeted melting point for precise temperature control (no freezing!).
     * Six coolant panels seamlessly fit around the vaccine to eliminate warm/cold spots.

  1. **VIP (the insulation)**
     * This space-age material (yes, it’s been up to the space station) provides more with less.
     * More R-value (protection) with less bulk (the 1″ thick walls are equivalent to 5″ of standard insulation).

If you haven’t already, watch this [113-second explainer video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9G9pjNjopU&feature=youtu.be) to see the simplicity and effectiveness of Cool Cube™ PCM Coolers.

### B) Surge Capacity 101
#### How to Set Up and Manage Effective ACSs
During crises like natural disasters, pandemics, or other emergencies, the demand for healthcare can surge beyond the capacity of existing hospitals and clinics. Overcrowding can lead to compromised care quality, delayed treatment, and potential ethical dilemmas in resource allocation. Alternative Care Sites (ACSs) serve as temporary healthcare facilities established outside traditional settings. Convention centers, schools, stadiums, and even mobile units can all be transformed into ACSs. Dive deeper into the strategies and best practices for establishing and managing ACSs effectively in our recent blog post, [“Enhancing Emergency Preparedness: Building a Robust Patient Surge Capacity System.”](https://www.vericormed.com/enhancing-emergency-preparedness-building-a-robust-patient-surge-capacity-system/)
