### A) Have you experienced a shorter hold time?
#### Two Common Causes that Shorten Hold Times
If your Cool Cube™ isn’t holding the temps for 2-3 days, there are two things to check:
  1. Did the cooler get packed out with SOLID panels? If not, it’s like trying to cool down a soda with tap water instead of ice cubes. The power of the thermodynamics starts with the PCM being solid!
  2. Has the Temp-Shield™ Insulation System been inspected? The insulation of a Cool Cube™ is a critical component of its extended temperature hold time. A loose skin indicates vacuum loss (damage, puncture, leak, etc.). Without a vacuum seal, the panel(s) becomes like any other insulator and won’t hold the internal temperature as long. Click here to learn more about Cool Cube™ life expectancy and how to inspect and validate the cooler for years of use.

### A) Revolutionizing Vaccine Clinics
#### Technology that keeps vaccines at optimal temps.
During vaccination clinics, healthcare workers frequently access vaccines stored in portable coolers that require repeated opening and closing. Unlike traditional fridges that allow cold air to escape when opened, the Cool Cube™ features a top-open design, keeping cold air inside and warm ambient air above. When closed, the incorporated phase change technology swiftly restores any trapped warm air to the desired temperature. A three-day simulation of opening and closing the cooler was conducted in a warm, humid environment to validate this design’s effectiveness. Impressively, the [Cool Cube™ 08 @ Refrigerated Temps](https://www.vericormed.com/product/cooler-cool-cube-08-vaccine-transport-cooler-at-refrigerator-temperatures-fresh-vaccine-vt-08/) maintained the required 2-8°C temperature range for 82 hours despite being opened 56 times during the test.
