### B) Data Loggers for Cold Chain Compliance
#### Back in stock!
The cold chain is about controlling the environment of temperature-sensitive product so that it is in optimal condition when it’s needed. Exposure to any unacceptable condition results in significant problems. That is why the CDC recommends using a specific type of temperature monitoring device known as a Digital Data Logger (DDL). A DDL continuously monitors the temperature (for prevention) and records data points (for detailed information if excursions happen). VeriCor carries a line of DDLs hundreds of customers have turned to as simple, affordable solutions. And now they are BACK IN STOCK!
