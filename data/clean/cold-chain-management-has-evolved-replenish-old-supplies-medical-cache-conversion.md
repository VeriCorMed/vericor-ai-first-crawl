#### Cool Cube™ FAQ
**Question:** I don’t need buffering material?!?  
  
**Answer:** No. Many times this question elicits a chuckle with the rhetorical question “do you need buffering material in your fridge?” The directive “use appropriate insulating materials, such as bubble wrap, to protect vaccines from direct contact with the water bottles” is because those water bottles are at 0°C until fully melted. On the other hand, Cool Cube™ PCM cooling panels are at the same temp of what is being packed-out (4.5°C for the fridge variety, -21.5°C for the frozen models, or 21.5°C for the room temp variations) until fully melted…a small but BIG difference! So no, you do not need to occupy valuable pack-out space with non-essential insulating materials.

### Replenish Old Supplies![A Requirement of Preparedness](https://www.vericormed.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/A-Requirement-of-Preparedness-300x200.jpg)
#### Easy to order. Easy to replace.
Supply management (inventory control) of earmarked preparedness product can be daunting. Is equipment recalled? Are supplies expired? If you have a Response-Friendly® System, use the SmartBook™ inventory file and sort by “Expiration Date” to make sure that your product is up-to-date. Don’t have time? We understand. That’s why we have replenishment packages that range from “label n’ ship” to on-site replacement.
