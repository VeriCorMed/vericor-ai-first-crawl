![Triage & Treatment](https://www.vericormed.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Triage-Treatment.png)
Mass casualty incidences (MCIs) pose significant challenges to healthcare networks, often overwhelming their capacity and causing disruptions inpatient treatment. To effectively address this issue, VeriCor has developed an innovative solution—the Hospital Triage and Treatment System. This all-in-one mobile system offers intuitive features, easy maintenance, and the ability to deploy anywhere, making it an invaluable asset during emergencies.
## Triage & Treatment System Exercised
**Streamlining Emergency Response Efforts  
** VeriCor designed the Hospital Triage and Treatment System to expand patient treatment beyond traditional healthcare settings. With its intuitive and color-coordinated design, this system allows for efficient organization and rapid deployment of supplies. In the event of a surge of up to 100 patients, the system provides both secondary triage and definitive treatment, ensuring timely and effective care.**  
**  
**Ease of Maintenance for Efficient Operations**  
One of the key advantages of VeriCor’s system is its ease of maintenance. By simplifying inventory management and replenishment, healthcare managers can focus on critical tasks rather than administrative burdens. This streamlined approach enables healthcare professionals to allocate their time and energy to provide patients with quality care during high-stress situations.
**Flexibility and Mobility**  
The Hospital Triage and Treatment System’s mobility is a significant benefit appreciated by emergency responders. Its ability to deploy anywhere allows for immediate assistance at the site of the incident, reducing response time and saving lives. This flexibility enables the efficient allocation of healthcare resources to areas with the greatest need during a mass casualty incident.

**WHO** IS A TRIAGE & TREATMENT SYSTEM FOR?  
Any health care facility or coalition needing an emergency preparedness system for treating a surge of patients.
**WHAT** IS A TRIAGE & TREATMENT SYSTEM?  
A system of “modules” containing supplies needed to treat patients as they are triaged.  
Triage – supplies to prioritize patients by their injury type.  
Expectant Treatment – supplies to address victims who will not survive.  
Immediate Treatment – life-saving supplies for serious injuries.  
Delayed Treatment – supplies to care for victims requiring hospitalization.  
Minor Treatment – supplies to care for victims with less serious or minor injuries.
Each module contains different “care functions” with supplies specific to that type of care: Airway Management, Examination, Intravenous Therapy, Orthopedics, Post Mortem, Respiratory Therapy, Special Procedures, SPPE, Suction, Wound Care, Wound Closure, etc.
Supplies are organized within labeled medical cases so that emergency care providers will know exactly where an item is and where they can go to get more.
_The SmartBook™ brings it all together._
