### A) Customer Idea 💡: Better than alternative!
#### Using fridge panels for short transport.
A customer in possession of the VT-08 (Cool Cube™ 08 @ Refrigerated Temps) recently called and posed this question: “Can I deep-freeze the refrigerated panels and use them?”
Yes. Although not “qualified” by VeriCor, customers could absolutely qualify the process by putting it to the test. In fact, we did just that, and here are our results:
  * Placing the “refrigerator” panels (blue tabs) in a lab freezer set at -30°C, brought the panel temperature down to -30°C in about 10 hours.
  * Pack-out with the “refrigerated” panels was simple and easy. Within minutes the Cool Cube™ 08 at Refrigerated Temps was at a lab freezer temperature of -30°C.
  * Monitoring the temperature in an office setting (25°C), the Cool Cube™ internal temperature crept up ever so slowly at a rate of 1.7°C per hour.
  * The panels acclimate to the environment very quickly as either a solid or a liquid. It’s going through the “phase change” that takes the longest. So with the high-performing Temp-Shield™ Insulation system protecting the panels, this was not a surprise.
  * For nearly 6 hours (5.88 to be exact), the Cool Cube™ 08 at Refrigerated Temps was between -30°C and -20°C without payload. With a properly conditioned payload, hours would increase (hold longer).

If you already have a Cool Cube™ at Refrigerated Temps and are waiting on the back-ordered Lab Freezer temperature panels, test this concept out. We’d be surprised if it’s not better than any of the alternatives out there!

### C) Infection Control & Prevention PPE Kits
#### Protect staff and prevent the spread.
As we now are finding out, infectious diseases present unique challenges. VeriCor personal protective equipment (PPE) kits control the spread of disease by protecting staff and patients with the correct gear. Smaller, prepackaged modules ([12](https://www.vericormed.com/product/infection-control-and-prevention-ppe-12-kits-ss-icp-ppe12/) and [25](https://www.vericormed.com/product/infection-control-and-prevention-ppe-25-kits-ss-icp-ppe25/) single-use) are organized, size-labeled kits within a mobile storage case for quick deployment. The [100-contact module](https://www.vericormed.com/product/infection-control-and-prevention-ppe-100-ss-icp-ppe100/) organizes all PPE into four mobile cases and includes an inventory management SmartBook™ for easy rotation and handling. Be ready with a VeriCor PPE Kit made by the preparedness experts. ***CURRENTLY OUT OF STOCK. Call to be placed on a waitlist.***
