### A) Vaccination Systems
#### The History
In 2006, VeriCor developed POD (point of dispensing) kits. These kits organized and mobilized the supplemental supplies required to rapidly dispense medical countermeasures (vaccines, antiviral drugs, antibiotics, antitoxins, and chemical antidotes used to prevent, mitigate, or treat adverse health effects of an intentional, accidental, or naturally occurring public health emergency). What soon followed was a “Vaccinator” kit—a mobile, compact system specifically for seasonal flu clinics. As they say, the rest is history…

### B) Off-Site Vaccination Kits
#### Make it Easy!
Save time and streamline upcoming vaccinations with prepackaged kits from VeriCor. The easy-to-store, simple-to-move, “just add staff & vaccine” kits come in three sizes ([500](https://www.vericormed.com/product/vaccinator-500-go-bag-vaccination-module-vs-500gb/), [2500](https://www.vericormed.com/product/vaccinator-2500-go-system-vaccination-module-vs-2500gs/), and [5000-person](https://www.vericormed.com/product/vaccinator-5000-system-with-refrigerator-vaccination-module-vs-5000r/)). The smaller kits are ideal for general clinics, while the larger “systems” are ready to vaccinate the masses.

### C) A mess of supplies…
#### …can be made new again!ared!
Sometimes emergency preparedness supplies are forgotten or not given attention until it is too late. Expired, unorganized, damaged, and recalled assets will hinder a response, and that’s where we can help. The Medical Cache Conversion process converts a mess of supplies into a ready-to-respond system that is organized & manageable. Ensure that when a mass causality incident (MCI) happens, supplies are ready. Click the picture/button to learn more, or call 608-526-6901 to speak with an experienced VeriCor staff member today.
