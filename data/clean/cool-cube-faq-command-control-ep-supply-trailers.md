### Cool Cube™ FAQ![The Cool Cube™ Advantage](https://www.vericormed.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/the-cool-cube-advantage-300x200.jpg)
#### A Question from Your Colleagues
**Question:** How are these different than the ice/Igloo combination I use now?  
  
**Answer:** This short [2-minute video (click here)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9G9pjNjopU&feature=youtu.be) explains it well. But if you don’t have two minutes, here it is in brief…  
Ice and off-the-shelf coolers are for chilling beverages, not managing critical temperatures for life-saving products. Ice melts at 0°C/32°F, and very few temp-sensitive products want to be at 0°C/32°F. The difference? Cool Cube™ temperature regulating panels are engineered to maintain a safe temperature for specific products.  
The insulation of the Cool Cube™ is the best on the market for keeping out ambient temperatures. The 1″ thick vacuum panels insulate better than 3.3″ of polyurethane — the insulation found in other “high-performance” coolers. This translates into less bulk and better protection for temp sensitive products.  
The construction is creative but simple. If/when the ambient temperatures get past the insulation, the PCM (phase change material) panels take control. Both the insulation and PCM surround the product, eliminating warm/cold spots while enabling a quick, easy pack-out.

#### HICS: Anywhere & Anytime
In preparation for the next logistical, operational or command situation, organize needed supplies within a colorful Hospital Incident Command Station by VeriCor. In storage it takes up the space of a desk. In deployment it facilitates command and control. A built-in laptop stand, overhead light, inlay map/document grease board, and two Easyboards® are just a few of the features of this case. Pair it with the [HICS Support Module](https://www.vericormed.com/product/hospital-incident-command-support-module-sm-hics/) (or your own kit) and be ready to respond anytime…anywhere.
