### A) ASPR’s Burn Care Statement
#### Burn care is a priority!
In ASPR’s 2017-2022 Health Care Preparedness and Response Capabilities, on page 52 – Activity 6 it states, “All hospitals should be prepared to receive, stabilize, and manage burn patients.”
If NOT ready for this type of medical surge response, check out this burn care medical kit: [MK-BC](https://www.vericormed.com/product/burn-care-medical-kit-module-mk-bc/). This Response-Friendly® Burn Care MedKit is a simple, comprehensive kit of supplies intuitively organized into an exclusive, vertical UMO (a roll pack/jump bag that opens to hang on a stand, door or other supportive structure). Essential supplies for the debridement and dressing of burns come intuitively prepackaged in the organizer…that any medical professional will appreciate. An easy-to-assemble stand and SmartBook™ are included.

### B) CDC’s 2019 Toolkit (revisited)
#### Read prior to fall vaccination campaigns.
Earlier this year the CDC published its redesigned [Vaccine Storage and Handling Toolkit](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/admin/storage/toolkit/storage-handling-toolkit.pdf). Unlike other revisions, this publication was an all-out revamp: new formatting, graphics, and content. To save time, check out the blog [“CDC Vaccine Storage & Handling Toolkit 2019 – What changed?”](https://www.vericormed.com/cdc-vaccine-storage-and-handling-toolkit-2019-what-changed/) that covers the differences.
If you are in need the type of cooler they refer to or a DDL (digital data logger) they emphasize, be sure to visit our online store. Cool Cube™ PCM Coolers are used by many VFC programs across the nation and are independently tested to verify their outstanding performance!

### C) Infectious Disease Preparedness
#### Ready-to-use PPE kits!
An infectious disease will pose unique challenges that diminish your healthcare’s response to an emergency. Have on-hand prepositioned personal protective equipment (PPE) kits to control the spread of disease and enable the continuity of health care services. Smaller, prepackaged modules ([12](https://www.vericormed.com/product/ebola-ppe-12-kits-ss-evd12/) and [25](https://www.vericormed.com/product/ebola-ppe-25-kits-ss-evd25/) single-use kits) are organized, size-labeled kits within a mobile storage case for quick deployment. The [100-contact module](https://www.vericormed.com/product/ebola-ppe-100-ss-evd100/) organizes all PPE into four mobile cases, and includes an inventory management SmartBook™ for easy rotation and handling. Customization options are available.
