No question is too big or small, because if you are thinking it…so are others. Emergency preparedness is complex and so questions need to be asked. More questions lead to more answers and better solutions. So if you don’t find your answer below, please ask at info@vericormed.com or call (608) 526-6901.  

#### Can I get VeriCor’s Form W-9?
​​Yes you can. Download it [here](https://www.vericormed.com/download-pdf/2024-vericor-w-9-signed/) or call us to get it faxed or emailed to you.
#### Can I buy your product online?
​​Most products you can…right on this site. Looking elsewhere? Some of our products are on Amazon, Ubuy, and GSA Advantage. However, we do take orders over the phone and we try to make that as simple as possible…so feel free to call us!
#### I want your products…how can I buy them?
Most you can find and buy right here on this site. If you prefer (or are required) to use Purchase Orders (POs), we have detailed instructions available on our [How to Order with a Purchase Order page](https://www.vericormed.com/how-to-order/#purchaseorderhowto). Additionally, orders over $10,000 cannot be made through the website checkout and must be placed using a purchase order. You can also call or email us for assistance—our customer service team is here to help!
#### Do you ship internationally?
To certain countries…yes. When you contact us, we’ll do our best to provide you with a quote that includes shipping to wherever you are in the world. However, as international shipping regulations and processes vary, we may need your assistance to ensure successful delivery.
One option is MyUs.com. VeriCor has partnered with MyUS.com, the No. 1 international shipping service, to bring our products to you. With MyUS.com, you are assigned a U.S.-based address where your package will be processed for shipping straight to your home country. MyUS.com uses trusted delivery services like FedEx, UPS and DHL to ensure you receive your merchandise in the shortest amount of time.
To get started:
  1. Sign up with MyUS.com and get your MyUS address to use at checkout.
  2. Shop online at US stores, and have your packages sent to your MyUS address.
  3. Your shipments will arrive at your door in 2-4 business days

If you are ordering multiple items, be sure to select the “Premium Membership” for greatest savings!
#### Do you have a distributor?
We sure do…Grainger, Evolve, Control Solutions, and others! Contact your representative or local branch to see if they carry our products. If not, let them know about us and encourage them to stock our products!
#### How long does it take to get the products I purchased?
​​It depends on the product and time of year. A medical case takes a lot less time to process and get out to you compared to a patient surge system tailored for your organizations specific requirements. Small items like Cool Cubes™ and temperature monitors usually ship out the day after receiving the order.
#### Do you provide product training or support?
​​Absolutely. We offer training resources, documentation, and expert support to help you make the most of your VeriCor products. Contact us directly to inquire about available resources or to schedule a consultation.
#### What is your return policy?
We want to be sure you’re as satisfied with your VeriCor products as we are. If you’re not 100% happy with your purchase, you can return it for a refund within 15 days of your receipt of the product. For products purchased from an authorized dealer or retailer, their return policy applies—please contact them directly for more information. For full details, please visit our [Returns and Refunds Policy page](https://www.vericormed.com/return-refund-policy/).
#### Are your products customizable?
Many of our products are customizable to meet your unique needs. Whether you need tailored medical cases, patient surge systems, or Cool Cubes™ designed for specific applications, we’re here to help. Reach out to discuss your requirements and explore custom options.
#### What if I have a question not listed here?
We’re here to help with any questions you have! Contact us at info@vericormed.com or (608) 526-6901, and we’ll get you the answers you need.
