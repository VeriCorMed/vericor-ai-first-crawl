### B) A Mess of Supplies Made Pretty
#### …and more importantly READY!
Sometimes emergency preparedness supplies don’t get the attention they need in order to be ready for use. Expired, unorganized, damaged, recalled…any number of things can hinder a response for when it is needed most. VeriCor’s Medical Cache Conversion process converts a mess of supplies into a ready-to-respond system that is organized and manageable, so that when an MCI happens your facility will be ready.

When a disaster hits, one of the first things needed are beds. It’s what people will turn to for comfort, rest and treatment. The line of beds VeriCor carries meet FEMA guidelines (and ADA compliance standards) while having a folding design for easy and compact storage. But more importantly they are dependable and comfortable for when they will be needed most. All beds (and racks) are made in the USA.
