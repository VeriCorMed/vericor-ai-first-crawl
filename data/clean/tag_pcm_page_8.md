Temp Holding PCM Panels*Very Different From Ice Bottles*When using conditioned water bottles as a coolant, bottles plateau at 0°C until completely thawed. When using conditioned PCM panels as a coolant, panels plateau at 4.5°C until completely thawed. Which coolant is safer to have next to valuable vaccine, blood, medicine or other refrigerated product…0°C or 4.5°C?
