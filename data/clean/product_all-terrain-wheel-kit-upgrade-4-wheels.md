The All-Terrain Wheel Upgrade (UP-ATWK) is a set of wheels installed during assembly (replacing the standard wheels) that make it easier to move a VeriCor case over many different terrains. These lower profile tires, with low rolling resistance, have a vastly wider load dispersion over soft terrain compared to standard wheels. Four wheels and mounting (when purchased with a case) included. (***This upgrade can only be purchased in conjunction with a case. This is not a stand-alone item for a retrofit.)
