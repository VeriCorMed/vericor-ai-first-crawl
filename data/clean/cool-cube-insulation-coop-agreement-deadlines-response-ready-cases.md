#### VIPs are a Very Important Part
Some coolers are bulky. Others cannot hold a temperature well. The Cool Cube™ solves both problems. At just 1″ thick, its vacuum insulated panels (VIPs) perform better than 3.3″ of polyurethane — the insulation found in other high performance coolers. This unique feature (one of many) ensures that sensitive product placed inside stays at the right temperature for days. Cool Cubes™ may be over-engineered for present-day guidelines, but isn’t life-saving vaccine/blood/medicine worth it?
