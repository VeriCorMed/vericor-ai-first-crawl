### A) Demand Up – Supply Down
#### Order now, so you have it when you need it!
Demand is up, and the supplies are down for products we need to create for you: Cool Cube™ PCM Coolers, vaccination kits, medical kits, surge systems, and workstations. We are doing everything possible to keep our pricing down and products flowing out to you. However, there is no visible end to the supply chain issues, which means longer wait times and higher prices. **Our best advice: order now and be patient.** (Last-minute ordering is not recommended.) Thank you for your continued support!

### A) Back Orders Starting Again ☹
#### Currently: Cool Cube™ 08 models
We were back in stock of everything a little over two months ago. However, with current supply chain issues, Cool Cube™ PCM Coolers are beginning to go into back order again. 03, 28, and 96 models are still available and shipping immediately. 08 models have roughly a 3-week delay, which may grow depending on orders. Order now for those June deadlines!
If you haven’t already, watch this [113-second explainer video](https://youtu.be/N9G9pjNjopU) to see the simplicity and effectiveness of Cool Cube™ PCM Coolers.

### B) Hospital Incident Command Station
#### Compact & Mobile — Move it Anywhere
Establish command and control with a mobile HICS (Hospital Incident Command System) case. During storage, it can be out of the way and take up the footprint of a desk. But during deployment, it can transform into a serious multi-tool with a power management system, table, organizational chart, overhead light, laptop stand, inlay map/document grease board, and numerous drawers and shelves to enable supply organization. Pair it with the [HICS Support Module](https://www.vericormed.com/product/hospital-incident-command-support-module-sm-hics/) (or your kit), and be ready to respond anytime, anywhere!

### C) Renew Your System!
#### Replace expired or used products efficiently.
Most preparedness systems have been ransacked due to the pandemic? If it’s a VeriCor Response-Friendly® System, the good news is that it’s built on a sustainable platform. Let us know what needs to be re-stocked, and we can send you pre-packaged supplies with location tags and a new SmartBook™. Or our experts can do a full-service, on-site replenishment to save you both time and labor. Whatever the case may be, let us audit the system to see what’s expired and give you some options.
