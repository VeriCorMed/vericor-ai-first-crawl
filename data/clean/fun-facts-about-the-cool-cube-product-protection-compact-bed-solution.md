### A) Did You Know?
#### Fun Facts about the Cool Cube™
  * The CDC had a picture of one of the first versions of the [Cool Cube™ 03](https://www.vericormed.com/product/cool-cube-03-at-fridge-temperatures-vt-03-vaccine-transport-cooler/) on the cover of the 2018 Vaccine Storage & Handling Toolkit. [(See that archived version here)](https://www.vericormed.com/download-pdf/2018-storage-handling-toolkit-january-2018/).
  * The [Cool Cube™ 96 @ Refrigerated Temps](https://www.vericormed.com/product/cool-cube-96-vaccine-transport-cooler-at-refrigerator-temperatures-for-fresh-vaccine-vt-96/) can hold 134 boxes (or 1400 vials) of vaccine between 2-8°C for 126 hours (or 5+ days) in the summer heat (a 71-95°F cycling temperature).
  * The shell (case and insulation) of a Cool Cube™ 08 weighs just 3 pounds more than a similar-in-size Igloo Playmate® cooler. So, you get a performance cooler tailored for medical products for a tad extra weight.
  * Utilizing just one of the phase change material (PCM) panels that comes with the [Cool Cube™ 08 @ Refrigerated Temps](https://www.vericormed.com/product/cooler-cool-cube-08-vaccine-transport-cooler-at-refrigerator-temperatures-fresh-vaccine-vt-08/) results in a 2-8°C hold time of 22 hours in an office environment. Utilizing all six PCM panels increases the time to more than 130 hours.
  * The Cool Cube™ 28 & 96 models have a dedicated pocket outside the case and a cord port that enables the temperature probe to “pass through” the case wall.
  * Cool Cube™ PCM coolers are being utilized in 49 of 50 states here in the USA. Customer testimonials are [here](https://www.vericormed.com/testimonials/).
