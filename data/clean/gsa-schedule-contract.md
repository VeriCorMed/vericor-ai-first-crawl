**HOLMEN, WI – February 4, 2015 –** VeriCor, LLC, the global producer of Response-Friendly™ systems, products and services, today announced that it is now listed on the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) Schedule 84. The five-year contract allows for Federal customers to efficiently purchase the wide range of VeriCor products and services. The GSA establishes long-term, government-wide contracts with commercial vendors to streamline and standardize the process of procuring products and services for the entire Federal government. VeriCor’s inclusion as a GSA Schedule 84 vendor enables all government agencies to obtain total solutions for law enforcement, security, facilities management, fire, rescue, and emergency/disaster response.
“VeriCor is very pleased to make our services available through the GSA,” said George Bushek, President of VeriCor, LLC. “By reducing the procurement challenge, our GSA Schedule 84 contract helps VeriCor and prospective government clients focus on what matters most, efficiently evaluating and resolving critical emergency response challenges.”
The GSA Schedule 84 award is the culmination of a rigorous process in which the GSA carefully evaluates companies to determine their proficiency and suitability for providing products and/or services to the Federal government. The assessment covers an array of a corporation’s capabilities, including organizational structure, performance history, customer satisfaction, and other criteria. In awarding VeriCor a GSA Schedule 84 contract, the Federal government has determined that the company is recognized as a preferred vendor that is fully authorized to conduct business directly with Federal government agencies.
“This Schedule 84 contract will expand VeriCor’s ability to work with federal, state and local agencies, and offer fast and affordable access to our systems, products and services. We’ve worked hard through the proposal process to demonstrate VeriCor’s past and current performance history, management processes, financial stability, and customer satisfaction. I’m proud of the VeriCor Team for this tremendous win,” said Mr. Bushek.
