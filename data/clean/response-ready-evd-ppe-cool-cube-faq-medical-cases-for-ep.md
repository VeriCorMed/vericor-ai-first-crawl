#### Infectious Disease Determent
Infectious disease incidents pose unique challenges that diminish a healthcare’s response to an emergency. So having ready prepositioned PPE kits to control the spread of disease and enable the continuity of health care services should save lives. VeriCor’s smaller, prepackaged modules (12 and 25 single-use kits) are organized within a mobile storage case for quick deployment. The [100-patient contact module](https://www.vericormed.com/product/ebola-ppe-100-ss-evd100/) integrates all PPE into four mobile cases, and includes an inventory management SmartBook™ for easy rotation and handling. Customization options are available.

### Cool Cube™ FAQ![A Question from Your Colleagues](https://www.vericormed.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/A-Question-from-Your-Colleagues-300x200.jpg)
#### A Question From Your Colleagues
**Question:** Is buffering material needed?  
  
**Answer:** No. The phase change material (PCM) technology that controls the temperature of the Cool Cube™ is a safe, simple solution that does not require the use of space-hogging buffering material. The PCM panels are very close to, if not at, the temperature of the product. So when packed-out, PCM surrounds the product (all 6 sides), protecting and maintaining its temperature. And because the panels are at the correct temperature, no buffering material is needed, leaving more room for product and simplifying the SOP. Check out the short video [here (< 2 min.)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9G9pjNjopU&feature=youtu.be) to see just how simple the Cool Cube™ system is.
