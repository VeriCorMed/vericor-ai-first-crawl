### B) Replenishment Made Easy
#### When it’s time to re-stock…
Hands may have been dipping into that preparedness system for responding to COVID-19. The good news is, if it’s a VeriCor Response-Friendly® System it’s built on a sustainable platform. Let us know the supplies that need to be re-stocked, and we can send you packaged supplies (with location tags) along with a new SmartBook™. If the labor and time would still be too much, we can do a full-service, on-site replenishment. Maybe it hasn’t been touched in a while? Let us do an audit on the system and see what’s expired and give you some options. Call (608) 526-6901 today to speak with a replenishment specialist.

### C) Convert boxes into an organized system!
#### Have us do all the work.
Sometimes emergency preparedness supplies are forgotten. Expired, unorganized, damaged, recalled…any number of things can hinder a response. The Medical Cache Conversion process converts a mess of supplies into a ready-to-respond system that is organized & manageable. Make sure that when an mass causality incident (MCI) happens, your supplies are ready. Call (608) 526-6901 today to speak with a cache conversion specialist.
