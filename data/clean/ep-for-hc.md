![EP Healthcare header](https://www.vericormed.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/EP-Healthcare-header.png)
Healthcare facilities must be ready to handle many different types of emergencies that threaten the health and safety of families, communities, and the nation. Since 2006, VeriCor has worked hard to give hospitals, clinics, and coalitions solutions to their emergency medical needs: patient surge systems; incident command systems; alternate treatment sites; storage and distribution of critical medicines and supplies. Click on any of the product lines below for more information. But if you need help finding the right solution, call (608) 526-6901 or send an email to info@vericormed.com.
**Cool Cube™ PCM Coolers**
Cool Cube™ PCM coolers passively control the temperature of cargo for an extended period of time (in most cases days!). Six removable panels utilize PCM technology to eliminate the use of ice or electricity, and make maintaining the cold chain easy, safe, and effective. During extremely hot conditions, a Cool Cube™ excels at keeping sensitive product at the needed temperature. But it can also keep product from freezing in dreadfully cold environments. Refrigerated, frozen and controlled room temperature variations available. Click on any of the product lines below for more information. But if you need help finding the right solution, call (608) 526-6901 or send an email to info@vericormed.com.
