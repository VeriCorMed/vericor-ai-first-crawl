_About**Room Temperature PCM** (Phase Change Material)_
PCM absorbs and releases thermal energy during the process of melting and freezing. When solid PCM melts, it absorbs the heat from the environment, yet its temperature stays at the melting point until totally liquid. Conversely, when liquid PCM freezes, it absorbs the cold from the environment yet stays at its temperature until totally solid. Therefore, PCM an ideal, passive solution for a variety of applications that require temperature control. The most common PCM is water, which has a melting point of 0 °C (32 °F). When solid, ice/water maintains a temperature of 0°C until it turns completely liquid. So, in essence, the 0 °C melting point makes it unsafe for most temperature-sensitive applications.
Cool Cube™ **Room Temp PCM** has a melting point of 21.5 °C/70.7 °F. When the PCM is solid, a panel helps the Cool Cube™ stay cool (about 22 °C) in hot environments. When the PCM is liquid, a panel helps the Cool Cube™ stay warm (about 21 °C) in cold conditions. It’s right around that 21.5 °C/70.7 °F where a PCM panel’s temperature plateaus for a while during the warming up and/or cooling down processes.

![Controlled Room Temps - Prep Method A - Lab Incubator Prep to keep product cool](https://www.vericormed.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Room-Temps-Prep-A-1.png)
#### Prep Method A: Lab Incubator Prep to keep product cool
**Panel Prep**
**2.1 Lay panels flat in a lab incubator** (or other 15-20°C environment) until all the PCM (phase change material inside the panel) turns solid. At 15°C/59°F the PCM will solidify in a day or two.*
* If the incubator temperature is ever warmer than 20°C, panels may not get completely solid (manufacturing tolerances). If stored within the temperature parameters of the product, but are still liquid, panels may be used but the hold time will decrease. Although panels are liquid, the PCM inside is at the temperature of storage environment after 3 hours (i.e. stored in a 22°C incubator, the PCM panels are at 22°C). Assembling the Cool Cube™ with this additional thermal mass will keep product at room temperature, just for a shorter amount of time than the lab-validated results.

![Shake PCM Panel To Check](https://www.vericormed.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Shake-PCM-Panel-To-Check-150x150.png)
**2.2 Shake panels to verify the PCM is solid.** If there is liquid, restart at step 2.1 to ensure the longest hold time. Using liquid PCM or panels with a solid/liquid combination decreases the hold time.

![Prep Method B - Fridge/Room Prep to keep product cool](https://www.vericormed.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Room-Temps-Prep-B-1.png)
#### Prep Method B: Fridge/Room Prep to keep product cool
**Panel Prep**
**2.1 Lay panels flat in a refrigerator** until all the PCM (phase change material inside the panel) turns solid. At 4°C/39°F the PCM will solidify in a couple hours.
**2.2 Spread panels out (enable airflow to all sides) in a room just before use** to allow the

          * “08” size = 40 minutes

          * “28” size = 45 minutes

          * “96” size = 50 minutes

**Times based on a 22°C/72°F room. 

![Shake PCM Panel To Check](https://www.vericormed.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Shake-PCM-Panel-To-Check-150x150.png)
**2.3 Shake panels to verify the PCM is solid with just a little liquid.** If a little liquid is heard, it is at 21.5°C. If there is a lot of liquid, restart at step 2.1 to ensure the longest hold time. Using liquid PCM or panels with a solid/liquid combination decreases the hold time. Wipe off condensate and proceed with assembly.

![Room Temps Prep Method C - Lab Incubator Prep to keep product warm](https://www.vericormed.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Room-Temps-Prep-C-1.png)**
#### Prep Method C: Lab Incubator Prep to keep product warm
**Panel Prep**
**2.1 Place panels in a lab incubator 23-24°C** for at least 24 hours before use so the PCM (phase change material inside the panel) is liquid.*
* Panels may be stored in the fridge until needed for assembly or the PCM solidifies. If an incubator maintains 23°C or above, the PCM within the panels will not get solid (the solidifying point is 21.5°C), keeping the PCM liquid indefinitely until pack-out. Liquid panels will protect the product from getting cold until the PCM inside becomes completely solid.

![Shake PCM Panel To Check](https://www.vericormed.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Shake-PCM-Panel-To-Check-150x150.png)
**2.2 Shake panels to verify the PCM is liquid.** If they are solid, restart at step 2.1 to  
ensure the longest hold time. Liquid PCM panels will prevent the product from getting cold (at room temps) in a cold environment the longest. Using solid PCM or panels with a solid/liquid combination decreases the hold time.

#### Prep Method D: Room Prep to keep product warm
**Panel Prep**
**2.1 Place panels in a room between 23-24°C** for at least 24 hours before use so the PCM (phase change material inside the panel) is liquid.*
* Panels may be stored in a room until needed for assembly or the PCM solidifies. If a room maintains 23°C or above, the PCM within the panels will not get solid (the solidifying point is 21.5°C), keeping the PCM liquid indefinitely until pack-out. Liquid panels will protect the product from getting cold until the PCM inside becomes completely solid.

**About Controlled Room Temps PCM Passive Temperature Technology**
![Thermal Properties of Series 22 PCM Panels](https://www.vericormed.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Room-Temps-Panel-Shake-Test.png)
Phase change materials (PCMs) are materials that absorb and release thermal energy during the process of melting and freezing. When a PCM melts, it absorbs the heat from the environment, yet its temperature stays at the melting point until totally liquid. Conversely, when a PCM freezes, it absorbs the cold from the environment, yet stays at its temperature until totally solid. This makes PCM an ideal, passive solution for a variety of applications that require temperature control. The most common PCM is water/ice. Ice is an excellent PCM for maintaining temperatures at 0°C. But water’s freezing point is fixed at 0°C (32°F), which makes it unsuitable for most temperature sensitive applications.
Cool Cube™ PCMs offer custom temperature holds based on their melting point. The PCM inside Controlled Room Temperature panels has a melting point of 21.5°C/70.7°F. When panels are solid, contents within the Cool Cube™ stay at room temperature (around 21.5°C) in hot conditions during an extended period of time. When panels have liquid inside, contents within the Cool Cube™ won’t get cold (again at room temps around 21.5°C) in cold conditions during an extended period of time.

      * Always prep the PCM panels before use according to one of the described methods provided by VeriCor.

      * Ensure all components are clean and free of damage.

      * During prep, enable ample air flow around all panel sides (use spacers or racks).

      * Lay panels flat when “freezing”.

      * Freeze/melting times vary depending on number of panels being prepped and equipment specifications being used. Assemble using all six panels for maximum hold time.

      * Using less panels does not change the holding temperature but does decrease hold time.

      * Panels are reusable (10,000+ cycles). (End-of-life disposal: panels use a plastic #2, typically recycled by businesses/communities; PCM is nontoxic and readily biodegradable.)

      * Use a calibrated data logger or other temperature monitoring device to observe internal temperature.

      * Avoid unnecessary opening of the Cool Cube™ after loading payload. Opening of the Cool Cube™ will decrease hold time.

      * An infrared temperature thermometer can assist in ensuring the panels reach a safe pack-out temperature (good for finding out the approximate temperature of each panel).

  * Further the temps are away from the melting point, the quicker PCM will change states.

[ l What is a PCM panel?  ](https://www.vericormed.com/product/cool-cube-28-specimen-transport-cooler-at-controlled-room-temperatures-for-ffpe-biospecimens-rt-28/)
A **PCM panel** in the Cool Cube is a key component that uses **Phase Change Material (PCM)** to help regulate the temperature inside the unit. These panels are designed to maintain specific temperature ranges crucial for protecting temperature-sensitive items like vaccines, medicines, and biological samples.
Each PCM panel contains a material that melts and solidifies at precise temperatures. As the surrounding temperature increases, the PCM inside the panel absorbs the heat and melts, stabilizing the environment. When the temperature decreases, the PCM solidifies and releases the stored heat, preventing the interior from cooling too rapidly.
In the Cool Cube, there are different types of PCM panels, each indicated by a color-coded tab, designed to maintain different temperature ranges: 
  * **Refrigerator PCM Panels (Blue Tab)** : 2°C to 8°C.
  * **Lab Freezer PCM Panels (Gray Tab)** : -50°C to -15°C.
  * **Room Temperature PCM Panels (Tan Tab)** : 15°C to 25° 

Each Cool Cube comes with 6 PCM panels that make up the PCM System.
[ l What is a VIP System?  ](https://www.vericormed.com/product/cool-cube-28-specimen-transport-cooler-at-controlled-room-temperatures-for-ffpe-biospecimens-rt-28/)
**Answer:**
The **VIP System** , or **Vacuum Insulated Panel System** , is a cutting-edge insulation technology used in Cool Cube products to provide superior thermal protection. VIPs are constructed with a core material surrounded by a vacuum-sealed barrier. This combination offers exceptional insulation, far more efficient than traditional materials like foam or polyurethane. Here’s how it works:
#### 1. Vacuum Insulation:
The vacuum inside the panels minimizes heat transfer by significantly reducing conduction and convection, which are the primary ways heat is transferred. This vacuum environment is key to achieving the high thermal resistance, or R-value, that makes VIPs so effective at keeping heat out and cold in (or vice versa).
#### 2. Efficiency:
VIPs can be up to five times more effective than conventional insulation, meaning they can maintain stable internal temperatures for much longer periods. This is particularly crucial in applications where temperature-sensitive products like vaccines, medicines, or biological samples are being stored or transported.
#### 3. Durability:
VIPs are built to last. The protective outer wrapping around the core helps ensure that the vacuum remains intact, maintaining the panel’s high insulation performance for years. Even after five years, VIPs can retain up to 95% of their original insulating power.
#### 4. Application in Cool Cubes:
In Cool Cubes, the VIP System works in tandem with PCM (Phase Change Material) panels to maintain precise temperature control for long durations, even in extreme conditions. The VIP System is housed within the outer case of the Cool Cube, ensuring that internal temperatures remain stable without relying on electricity or ice.
By utilizing VIP technology, Cool Cubes offer reliable, energy-efficient temperature control for critical applications like medical transport, off-site vaccination efforts, and emergency preparedness.
[ l What is PCM?  ](https://www.vericormed.com/product/cool-cube-28-specimen-transport-cooler-at-controlled-room-temperatures-for-ffpe-biospecimens-rt-28/)
PCM, or **Phase Change Material** , is a type of substance that can store and release large amounts of thermal energy as it changes from one state of matter to another, specifically between solid and liquid phases. This ability to absorb and release heat during its phase transitions makes PCM useful for controlling temperatures.
Here’s how it works: When a material melts (changes from a solid to a liquid), it absorbs heat from its surroundings, which cools down the environment around it. When the material freezes (changes from liquid back to solid), it releases the heat it had absorbed, warming up the environment.
What makes PCM special is that it is engineered to melt and freeze at very specific temperatures, depending on its formulation. For example, some PCM might be designed to melt at a relatively low temperature, like 5°C, while others might melt at higher temperatures. This allows PCM to be used for different applications, like keeping things cool or warm without the need for constant external energy, such as refrigeration.
Because PCM changes phases so efficiently, it can absorb or release a lot of heat without changing its own temperature much during the process. This makes it an excellent tool for maintaining stable temperatures over time, which is critical for safely transporting temperature-sensitive products like vaccines, medicines, and biological samples.
[ l What is a VIP Panel?  ](https://www.vericormed.com/product/cool-cube-28-specimen-transport-cooler-at-controlled-room-temperatures-for-ffpe-biospecimens-rt-28/)
Vacuum Insulation Panel – a form of thermal insulation consisting of a gas-tight enclosure surrounding a rigid core, from which the air has been evacuated.
[ l How does PCM improve cooling efficiency?  ](https://www.vericormed.com/product/cool-cube-28-specimen-transport-cooler-at-controlled-room-temperatures-for-ffpe-biospecimens-rt-28/)
**Answer:**
PCM (Phase Change Material) improves cooling efficiency by leveraging its ability to store and release large amounts of thermal energy during its phase transitions (melting and freezing). Unlike conventional cooling methods, PCM absorbs heat as it changes from solid to liquid, maintaining a stable temperature for longer periods without active refrigeration. When the temperature around the PCM drops, it re-solidifies, releasing the stored energy and continuing to regulate the temperature.
In the Cool Cube product line, PCM helps improve cooling efficiency in the following ways:
  * **Temperature Stability:** PCM maintains a precise, consistent temperature over time, reducing fluctuations that could compromise sensitive materials like vaccines or lab samples.
  * **Energy Efficiency:** By absorbing and releasing thermal energy, PCM minimizes the need for constant refrigeration or energy input, especially during transport, leading to lower energy consumption.
  * **Extended Cooling Duration:** PCM can maintain the desired temperature for a prolonged period, making it ideal for passive cooling solutions during transport or power outages, which improves overall cooling reliability.
  * **Freeze Protection:** PCM prevents the freezing of materials that should remain at above-freezing temperatures, avoiding the risk of damage due to ice or extreme cold.

By using PCM, Cool Cube products ensure that temperature-sensitive materials remain within safe temperature ranges with fewer external cooling interventions, thus increasing the overall efficiency and reliability of the system.
[ l What makes PCM superior to ice?  ](https://www.vericormed.com/product/cool-cube-28-specimen-transport-cooler-at-controlled-room-temperatures-for-ffpe-biospecimens-rt-28/)
**Answer:**
PCM (Phase Change Material) offers several advantages over traditional ice for temperature control, making it a superior choice in applications like the VeriCor Cool Cube. Here’s why:
  * **Precise Temperature Control:**  
Ice maintains a temperature around 0°C (32°F) as it melts, which can be too cold for many temperature-sensitive materials like vaccines and medicines. This can result in accidental freezing, which can ruin the products. PCM, on the other hand, is specifically formulated to maintain a precise temperature. For example: 
    * **Refrigerator PCM** holds temperatures between 2°C and 8°C.
    * **Lab Freezer PCM** holds temperatures around -20°C.
This targeted temperature control prevents freezing (in the case of refrigerator temps) or overheating (in the case of lab freezer temps), ensuring the materials stay within their required temperature range. 
  * **Longer Duration of Stable Temperatures:**  
PCM can maintain a consistent temperature for a longer period than ice. As ice melts, it quickly loses its cooling effectiveness. In contrast, PCM absorbs and releases heat more gradually during its phase change, keeping temperatures stable for extended periods. This makes PCM ideal for transporting materials over long distances or storing them during power outages. 
  * **Energy Efficiency:**  
PCM reduces the need for active refrigeration or the constant replacement of ice packs. It provides a passive, energy-efficient cooling solution. This not only saves energy but also reduces the hassle of constantly replenishing ice, particularly during transport. 
  * **No Risk of Water Damage:**  
When ice melts, it turns into water, which can damage packaging or create messes in storage units. PCM, however, remains self-contained within sealed containers as it changes phases, so there’s no risk of leaks or water damage. This ensures a cleaner, safer environment for sensitive materials. 
  * **Customized Temperature Ranges:**  
PCM can be tailored to specific temperature ranges based on the needs of the products being stored. Ice cannot be customized to maintain temperatures other than around 0°C, making it less versatile. PCM can be used in Cool Cubes for refrigeration, freezing, or even room temperature control, depending on the type of PCM selected. 
  * **Lightweight and Portable:**  
PCM is lighter than carrying large quantities of ice, making Cool Cubes easier to transport. Since PCM is engineered for efficiency, you need less of it compared to the amount of ice you would need for the same cooling effect, which enhances portability.

[ l Duties and Taxes  ](https://www.vericormed.com/product/cool-cube-28-specimen-transport-cooler-at-controlled-room-temperatures-for-ffpe-biospecimens-rt-28/)
Taxes: United States & Canada 
  * Calculated based on delivery location.
  * If $0.00 (Sales tax not collected) is apparent, either VeriCor doesn’t collect sales tax for that state or the order is identified as tax-exempt.
  * If tax-exempt, a valid tax exemption certificate is needed to process the order.

Brokerage: the fee associated with customs clearance for your inbound shipments. 
  * Paid by the “Importer of Record” (customer) based on the value of the shipment to the designated broker.
  * Broker can be identified by the customer prior to shipment (so they use their own), otherwise FedEx will be the default broker.
  * There are ways to avoid broker fees, but there’s time and work involved ([example](https://www.theartofdoingstuff.com/how-to-avoid-broker-fees-just-in-time-for-online-xmas-shopping/)).
