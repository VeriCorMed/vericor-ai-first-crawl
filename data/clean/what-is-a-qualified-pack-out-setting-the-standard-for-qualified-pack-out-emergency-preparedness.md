### A) What is a “Qualified Pack-Out?”
#### Defined by the CDC as…
A type of container and supplies specifically designed for use when packing vaccines for transport. They are passive containers that do not require a power source and are “qualified” through laboratory testing under controlled conditions to ensure they achieve and maintain desired temperatures for a set amount of time. 
(Vaccine Storage and Handling Toolkit – January 2023, p. 30)
