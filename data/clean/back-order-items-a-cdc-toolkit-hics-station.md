### A) Back Order Items
#### Working extra hard to get you the coolers you need.
The unprecedented surge of COVID-19 orders has resulted in numerous Cool Cube™ models being in a back order status. We are diligently working with the suppliers of Cool Cube™ parts to get the shipping time back to normal (typically 1-2 days). Stay safe and thank you for your patience!

### A) A CDC Toolkit “Qualified Container & Packout”
#### For fridge, freezer, or room temp backup/transport.
Easy to use phase change material (PCM) panels maintain contents at the desired temperature for an extended period of time. Smaller qualified coolers last 3+ days. Larger qualified coolers last 5+ days. This peace-of-mind is valuable for transport, backup and off-site use. Each of the four sizes of coolers can maintain a refrigerated, frozen, or controlled room temperature dependent upon the PCM panel system you use. If you haven’t already, watch this [113-second explainer video](https://youtu.be/N9G9pjNjopU) to see the simplicity and effectiveness of Cool Cube™ PCM Coolers.

### B) Hospital Incident Command System Station
#### A compact, mobile workstation for command & control.
Establish command and control with a mobile HICS (Hospital Incident Command System) case. During storage, it can be out of the way and take up the space of a desk. But during deployment, it can transform into a serious multi-tool with a power management system, table, organizational chart, overhead light, laptop stand, inlay map/document grease board, and numerous drawers and shelves to enable supply organization. Pair it with the [HICS Support Module](https://www.vericormed.com/product/hospital-incident-command-support-module-sm-hics/) (or your own kit) and be ready to respond anytime, anywhere.
