### A) The Global Situation
#### The WHO Coronavirus (COVID-19) Dashboard).
World Health Organization Coronavirus disease situation dashboard presents official daily counts of COVID-19 cases and deaths worldwide. With an easy-to-understand overview, measures, data tables, and more, it is a go-to place to get a glimpse of what is happening worldwide. The only knock on it is that the pages seem to load a bit slow so give it a little extra time (they might have a lot of traffic). Click here for the global situation.

### B) Mobilize Supplies in a Case that Moves
#### POC Workstations for Nurses
Vaccination campaigns (or any mobile medical initiative) can involve more supplies than providers want to drag around. VeriCor workstations give mobility to the load (bulky/heavy supplies) and organization to the plan. From stainless steel partitioned drawers for organization to glove holders in the lid for accessibility, these workstations are primed and ready for upcoming mobile campaigns!
