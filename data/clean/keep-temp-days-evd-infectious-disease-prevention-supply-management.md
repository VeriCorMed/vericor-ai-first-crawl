#### Keep the Same Temp for Days!
Power outages create major problems with vaccine storage (i.e. South Australia’s $400K loss last year). The ability to protect vaccines during a blackout is not easy since the typical vaccine fridge drifts above 8°C within a couple of hours after losing electricity. The article “Protect Vaccine During a Power Outage” calls out two major problems in regards to vaccine refrigerators and power outages. Meanwhile, freeze-safe Cool Cube™ coolers can be used for both off-site clinics AND as backups for blackouts. With Cool Cubes™ management can be assured that the cold chain is intact through the night, weekend, or any other multi-day span.
