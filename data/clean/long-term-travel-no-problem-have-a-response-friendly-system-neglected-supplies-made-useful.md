### A) Long-Term Travel? No Problem.
#### Ice-Free; Electricity-Free; Problem-Free
Users are always surprised on how consistent the Cool Cube™ holds a temperature, which is one of the reasons why they are so great for travel (long-term itineraries). Whether for medications, vaccine, or other temperature sensitive product, Cool Cube™ PCM coolers keeps refrigerated product 5°C/41°F and frozen product -20°C/-4°F for 3+ days…without using messy, too-cold ice or troublesome electricity. And don’t be worried about TSA (Transportation Security Administration) screening–they are fine with it. [Here](https://www.tsa.gov/travel/security-screening/whatcanibring/items/gel-ice-packs) is how they address it on their website. Nevertheless, print out VeriCor’s “[TSA Travel Doc](https://www.vericormed.com/?wpfb_dl=573)” to have a peace-of-mind when traveling (although they say it is not necessary).
If you haven’t already, watch this short [2-minute video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9G9pjNjopU&feature=youtu.be) to see the simplicity and dependability of the Cool Cube™.

### B) Have a Response-Friendly® System?
#### Exercise staff, supplies, and the plan with a training package.
You already know that having a Response-Friendly® System is very intuitive and well put-together. Nevertheless, if your EM team is in need of training this year, but time and resources are scarce, give us a call. Our staff can give your team a quick rundown on how to maximize the system, alleviating the typical stress and planning time involved with such exercises. From basic how-to management to full-out MCI scenarios, pick the package that ensures you and your staff are ready to respond.

### C) Neglected Supplies Made Useful
#### For an unorganized cache of supplies you don’t want to toss.
Sometimes emergency preparedness supplies don’t get the attention they need in order to be ready for use. Expired, unorganized, damaged, recalled…any number of things can hinder a response for when it is needed most. VeriCor’s Medical Cache Conversion process converts a mess of supplies into a ready-to-respond system that is organized and manageable, so that when an MCI happens your facility will be ready.
