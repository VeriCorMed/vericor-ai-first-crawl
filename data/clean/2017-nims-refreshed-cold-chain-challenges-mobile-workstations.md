#### A Case for All Incidents
Last month FEMA released the updated version of the National Incident Management System (NIMS). While reviewing the changes (see it here if you haven’t already), consider the compact, mobile HICS case for all incidents regardless of cause, size, location or complexity. A built-in laptop stand, overhead light, an inlay map/document greaseboard, and 2 Easyboards® are just a few of the wonderful features of this case!

#### & Easy Cold Chain Protection
Keeping cold chain temperature excursions to a minimum is an important task. It affects the safety and efficacy of valuable product. Chances are the next failure will be attributed to duration of time, varying exposure, or human error. How can these factors be reduced? Use a portable Cool Cube™ as a transport cooler, back-up fridge/freezer, or for off-site storage. Advanced PCM provides easy and safe temperature control for days!

#### On-the-Go Supply Management
Vaccination campaigns (or any mobile medical initiative) can involve more supplies than what providers want to tote around. VeriCor workstations give mobility to the load (bulky/heavy supplies) and organization to the plan. From covers that transform into tables to built-in refrigerators, these workstations have features to support a variety of medical campaigns.
