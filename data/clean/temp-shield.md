### Temp-Shield™ Insulation System: Advanced Thermal Protection
The Temp-Shield™ Insulation System, an essential component of VeriCor’s Cool Cube™ PCM coolers, is a cutting-edge solution engineered to maintain critical temperature stability for up to four days or more. This proprietary system utilizes Vacuum Insulated Panels (VIPs) to form an unmatched thermal barrier, ensuring the interior temperature remains consistent while protecting contents from external environmental conditions.

#### Features of the Temp-Shield™ VIP System
  * **Superior Insulation Technology:** Vacuum insulated panels (VIPs) offer up to five times the thermal resistance (R-value) of conventional insulation materials.
  * **Durable and Lightweight Design:** Each panel has a rigid structure encased in an aluminum membrane skin, vacuum-sealed for robust thermal performance without added weight.
  * **Protective Reinforcement:** Panels are encased in a reinforced, clear-plastic protective layer for enhanced durability and extended use.
  * **Replaceable and Modular** : Designed for easy replacement, the VIP system ensures prolonged efficiency and adaptability of the Cool Cube™.

#### How Temp-Shield™ Works in Harmony with PCM Panels
The Temp-Shield™ Insulation System plays an essential role in maintaining the Cool Cube’s highly stable environment for temperature-sensitive products. By encapsulating the Phase Change Material (PCM) panels, the VIP system creates a thermally controlled core that:
  * Reduces heat transfer from external sources.
  * Supports the PCM’s ability to absorb, store, and release thermal energy efficiently.
  * Maintains a steady temperature range, ideal for safeguarding medical and pharmaceutical products.

#### Technical Composition
Each Temp-Shield™ panel is constructed to maximize performance:
  * **Sealed Under Vacuum:** The vacuum minimizes thermal conductivity, ensuring exceptional insulation.
  * **Constructed with Powder Core:** The finely processed powder within the panel enhances thermal resistance.
  * **Encased in Aluminum Membrane:** The outer layer adds strength and acts as a barrier against external elements.

#### Collaboration Within the Cool Cube™ System
The Temp-Shield™ VIP system is the backbone of the Cool Cube™ system, integral to the performance of all models. It is the core insulating technology enabling consistent temperature control and reliability. While the PCM panels actively regulate temperature by absorbing and releasing heat, the Temp-Shield™ system reduces external thermal influence, ensuring that every component works in unison for peak efficiency.
VeriCor’s Cool Cube™ coolers—empowered by the Temp-Shield™ Insulation System—set the standard for long-term, dependable temperature control. Trusted by healthcare professionals, emergency responders, and logistics teams, this advanced technology provides peace of mind and assurance in the field.
