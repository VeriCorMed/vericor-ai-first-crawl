### Upgrade the Cold Chain![Safe, Qualified Transport, Not Just for Vaccine](https://www.vericormed.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/cc-300x200.jpg)
####  One Step at a Time or All at Once
If trying to keep vaccine or blood within parameters during transport is difficult, it’s time to upgrade!   

  * Need a **better insulator**? Cool Cube™ vacuum insulated walls are 5X more efficient than off-the-shelf coolers. At 1” thick, they perform like 5” of polyurethane. Result: less bulk.
  * Need an **ice pack replacement**? Cool Cube™ panels are engineered to be safer than conditioned bottles of ice. Water/ice mixtures that hover around 0°C (the melting point) are well below the required 2°-8°C or 1°-10°C range. Meanwhile, Cool Cube™ PCM panels that hover around 4.5°C (the melting point) are in that sweet spot of refrigerated product. Result: safe cooling replaces the danger of freezing. (Frozen and room temperature panels are available utilizing the same principle.)
  * Need a **longer lasting system**? Cool Cube™ coolers last can hold a specified temperature range for over 108 hours. The proper ratio of insulation and cooling panels create a safe, almost unbreakable cold chain that lasts for days.
