### Cool Cube™ FAQ![The Cool Cube™ Edge](https://www.vericormed.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/the-cool-cube-edge-300x200.jpg)
#### A Question from Your Colleagues
**Question:** There are other PCM coolers out there…what’s the difference?  
  
**Answer:** #1…the insulation keeps the internal temps steady longer AND prevents warm/cold spots. In other coolers (non-vacuum insulated), product near the edges are much more susceptible to damage caused by ambient temperatures. #2…the PCM panels that surround the product are made from natural sources such as palm oil, palm kernel oil, rapeseed oil, coconut oil and soybean oil. The nontoxic, biodegradable, hydrogenated compounds will not oxidize or become rancid and will be stable for decades because they do not have chemical sites for oxidation to occur. Don’t gamble with low-grade PCM next to your valuable, life-saving product…it’s not worth it. Cool Cube™ PCM is worth it!
