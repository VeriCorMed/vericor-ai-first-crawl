### A) Switch to better!
#### Safe – Easy – Efficient
It has been said that most consumers switch to “better, not cheaper” products. Whether or not that resonates with you, one thing is for certain…Cool Cube™ PCM coolers are the “better”.
  * They are safe…temperature controlling panels are AT the temperature of the product.
  * They are easy…pack-out is quick and foolproof. Panels and product are the only things needed (not buffering material and long SOPs).
  * They are efficient…the ratio of the total size to product capacity can’t be beat, especially in the two smaller sizes. The 1” thick insulation has seven times the R-value of polystyrene…imagine carrying a cooler around that has 7″ thick walls.

If you haven’t already, watch this short [2-minute video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9G9pjNjopU&feature=youtu.be) to see the simplicity and dependability of the Cool Cube™.

### B) Triage & Treatment…anywhere!
#### A system built specifically for MCIs!
Mass casualty incidences (MCIs) can overwhelm and disrupt a healthcare system – thus the need for surge preparedness. If it’s hard to imagine what a solid preparedness system looks like…[watch last year’s video of Greater LA VA exercising their Triage & Treatment System](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo_hfT2JOaY).
