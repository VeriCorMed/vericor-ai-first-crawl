### B) Protect Your Investment
`  
 `
#### Choose Two Probes
`  
 `
`  
 `VeriCor offers a premium line of digital data loggers (DDLs) trusted by thousands of clients for their reliable, straightforward temperature monitoring solutions. A common inquiry from our customers is whether to opt for a single or dual probe. Our recommendation is consistently two probes. For a minimal additional cost of $10, a second probe provides the flexibility to simultaneously monitor two distinct areas (e.g., ambient temperature and refrigeration or multiple coolers). Even if dual-zone monitoring isn’t an immediate requirement, the extra probe (also calibrated) serves as invaluable insurance against potential loss or damage to the primary sensor.
