### A) Simple Packout for 2020
#### Out with the old, in with the new!
If packout methods seem cumbersome and hard to get right (the Packing Vaccines for Transport during Emergencies for example), maybe 2020 is the year to get an easy & qualified, container and packout system. The Cool Cube™ is so simple to packout. Prep the phase change panels, place them in the cooler, put in the product (no buffering needed), and go. If you haven’t already, watch this [113-second explainer video](https://youtu.be/N9G9pjNjopU) to see the simplicity and effectiveness of Cool Cube™ PCM Coolers.

### B) Organize and Protect Valuable Supplies
#### Because cardboard boxes are not good enough.
When responding personnel go into the field, it is essential that medical supplies are safe, intact and ready for use. From the compact Upright Medical Organizer ([MC-UMO](https://www.vericormed.com/product/upright-medical-organizer-mc-umo-medical-roll-pack/)) to the rolling Mobile Charging Station ([MC-MCS](https://www.vericormed.com/product/mobile-charging-station-mc-mcs/)) to the Equipment Chest ([MC-EC](https://www.vericormed.com/product/medical-equipment-chest-mc-ec/)), checkout VeriCor’s wide array of options.

### C) Kits Ready to Protect Staff & Patients
#### Prevent the spread!
Infectious diseases present unique challenges. Our personal protective equipment (PPE) kits can control the spread of disease. Smaller, prepackaged modules ([12](https://www.vericormed.com/product/ebola-ppe-12-kits-ss-evd12/) and [25](https://www.vericormed.com/product/ebola-ppe-25-kits-ss-evd25/) single-use) are organized, size-labeled kits within a mobile storage case for quick deployment. The [100-contact module](https://www.vericormed.com/product/ebola-ppe-100-ss-evd100/) organizes all PPE into four mobile cases, and includes an inventory management SmartBook™ for easy rotation and handling. Be ready with a VeriCor PPE kit.
