# Room Temperature PCM
![Room Temps PCM series 22 header](https://www.vericormed.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Room-Temps-PCM-series-22-header.png)
Cool Cube™ Room Temperature PCM panels are nontoxic, biodegradable and have similar characteristics to that of water. However, unlike water the solidification point is customized to maximize the cooler’s ability to hold product at a room temperature for an extended period of time.
Room Temperature PCM turns solid when its temperature is below 21.5 °C/70.7 °F (unlike water which has a freezing point of 0 °C/32 °F). When using solid, Room Temp PCM panels in the Cool Cube™, packed out product will stay at room temperature in hot conditions for an extended period of time. When using liquid, Room Temp PCM panels in the Cool Cube™, packed out product will stay at room temperature in cold or freezing conditions for an extended period of time.

_About**Room Temperature PCM** (Phase Change Material)_
`  
 ``  
 ``  
 `
PCM absorbs and releases thermal energy during the process of melting and freezing. When solid PCM melts, it absorbs the heat from the environment, yet its temperature stays at the melting point until totally liquid. Conversely, when liquid PCM freezes, it absorbs the cold from the environment yet stays at its temperature until totally solid. Therefore, PCM an ideal, passive solution for a variety of applications that require temperature control. The most common PCM is water, which has a melting point of 0 °C (32 °F). When solid, ice/water maintains a temperature of 0°C until it turns completely liquid. So, in essence, the 0 °C melting point makes it unsafe for most temperature-sensitive applications.

 `
Cool Cube™ **Room Temp PCM** has a melting point of 21.5 °C/70.7 °F. When the PCM is solid, a panel helps the Cool Cube™ stay cool (about 22 °C) in hot environments. When the PCM is liquid, a panel helps the Cool Cube™ stay warm (about 21 °C) in cold conditions. It’s right around that 21.5 °C/70.7 °F where a PCM panel’s temperature plateaus for a while during the warming up and/or cooling down processes.

![Controlled Room Temps - Prep Method A - Lab Incubator Prep to keep product cool](https://www.vericormed.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Room-Temps-Prep-A-1.png)
#### Prep Method A: Lab Incubator Prep to keep product cool
**Panel Prep**
**2.1 Lay panels flat in a lab incubator** (or other 15-20°C environment) until all the PCM (phase change material inside the panel) turns solid. At 15°C/59°F the PCM will solidify in a day or two.*
* If the incubator temperature is ever warmer than 20°C, panels may not get completely solid (manufacturing tolerances). If stored within the temperature parameters of the product, but are still liquid, panels may be used but the hold time will decrease. Although panels are liquid, the PCM inside is at the temperature of storage environment after 3 hours (i.e. stored in a 22°C incubator, the PCM panels are at 22°C). Assembling the Cool Cube™ with this additional thermal mass will keep product at room temperature, just for a shorter amount of time than the lab-validated results.

![Shake PCM Panel To Check](https://www.vericormed.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Shake-PCM-Panel-To-Check-150x150.png)
**2.2 Shake panels to verify the PCM is solid.** If there is liquid, restart at step 2.1 to ensure the longest hold time. Using liquid PCM or panels with a solid/liquid combination decreases the hold time.

#### Prep Method B: Fridge/Room Prep to keep product cool
**Panel Prep**
**2.1 Lay panels flat in a refrigerator** until all the PCM (phase change material inside the panel) turns solid. At 4°C/39°F the PCM will solidify in a couple hours.
**2.2 Spread panels out (enable airflow to all sides) in a room just before use** to allow the PCM inside to rise to the appropriate operating temperature. Approximate times:
    * “03” size = 35 minutes
    * “08” size = 40 minutes
    * “28” size = 45 minutes
    * “96” size = 50 minutes
**Times based on a 22°C/72°F room.

**2.3 Shake panels to verify the PCM is solid with just a little liquid.** If a little liquid is heard, it is at 21.5°C. If there is a lot of liquid, restart at step 2.1 to ensure the longest hold time. Using liquid PCM or panels with a solid/liquid combination decreases the hold time. Wipe off condensate and proceed with assembly.

#### Prep Method C: Lab Incubator Prep to keep product warm
**Panel Prep**
**2.1 Place panels in a lab incubator 23-24°C** for at least 24 hours before use so the PCM (phase change material inside the panel) is liquid.*
* Panels may be stored in the fridge until needed for assembly or the PCM solidifies. If an incubator maintains 23°C or above, the PCM within the panels will not get solid (the solidifying point is 21.5°C), keeping the PCM liquid indefinitely until pack-out. Liquid panels will protect the product from getting cold until the PCM inside becomes completely solid.

**2.2 Shake panels to verify the PCM is liquid.** If they are solid, restart at step 2.1 to  
ensure the longest hold time. Liquid PCM panels will prevent the product from getting cold (at room temps) in a cold environment the longest. Using solid PCM or panels with a solid/liquid combination decreases the hold time.

#### Prep Method D: Room Prep to keep product warm
**Panel Prep**
**2.1 Place panels in a room between 23-24°C** for at least 24 hours before use so the PCM (phase change material inside the panel) is liquid.*
* Panels may be stored in a room until needed for assembly or the PCM solidifies. If a room maintains 23°C or above, the PCM within the panels will not get solid (the solidifying point is 21.5°C), keeping the PCM liquid indefinitely until pack-out. Liquid panels will protect the product from getting cold until the PCM inside becomes completely solid.

**About Controlled Room Temps PCM Passive Temperature Technology**  
![Thermal Properties of Series 22 PCM Panels](https://www.vericormed.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Room-Temps-Panel-Shake-Test.png)
Phase change materials (PCMs) are materials that absorb and release thermal energy during the process of melting and freezing. When a PCM melts, it absorbs the heat from the environment, yet its temperature stays at the melting point until totally liquid. Conversely, when a PCM freezes, it absorbs the cold from the environment, yet stays at its temperature until totally solid. This makes PCM an ideal, passive solution for a variety of applications that require temperature control. The most common PCM is water/ice. Ice is an excellent PCM for maintaining temperatures at 0°C. But water’s freezing point is fixed at 0°C (32°F), which makes it unsuitable for most temperature sensitive applications.
Cool Cube™ PCMs offer custom temperature holds based on their melting point. The PCM inside Series 22 panels has a melting point of 21.5°C/70.7°F. When panels are solid, contents within the Cool Cube™ stay at room temperature (around 21.5°C) in hot conditions during an extended period of time. When panels have liquid inside, contents within the Cool Cube™ won’t get cold (again at room temps around 21.5°C) in cold conditions during an extended period of time.

  * Always prep the PCM panels before use according to one of the described methods provided by VeriCor.
  * Ensure all components are clean and free of damage.
  * During prep, enable ample air flow around all panel sides (use spacers or racks).
  * Lay panels flat when “freezing”.
  * Freeze/melting times vary depending on number of panels being prepped and equipment specifications being used. Assemble using all six panels for maximum hold time.
  * Using less panels does not change the holding temperature but does decrease hold time.
  * Panels are reusable (10,000+ cycles). (End-of-life disposal: panels use a plastic #2, typically recycled by businesses/communities; PCM is nontoxic and readily biodegradable.)
  * Use a calibrated data logger or other temperature monitoring device to observe internal temperature.
  * Avoid unnecessary opening of the Cool Cube™ after loading payload. Opening of the Cool Cube™ will decrease hold time.
  * An infrared temperature thermometer can assist in ensuring the panels reach a safe pack-out temperature (good for finding out the approximate temperature of each panel).
  * Further the temps are away from the melting point, the quicker PCM will change states.
