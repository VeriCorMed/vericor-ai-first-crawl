### A) Cool Cube™ FAQ
#### _A Question From Your Colleagues_
`  
 `  
**Question** : “How long before I have to buy a new cooler?”
`  
 `  
**Answer** : Never (with some simple care). 
`  
 `  
The PCM (phase change material used in the cooling panels) is good for 10,000 cycles. Plus the PCM is non-toxic, 100% renewable, readily biodegradable, and sealed in durable, degradation-resistant panels. The other main component, the insulation system, is proven to be 95% after 5 years of use. So the [VT-08](https://www.vericormed.com/product/cooler-cool-cube-08-vaccine-transport-cooler-at-refrigerated-temperatures-fresh-vaccine-vt-08/) that lasts 76 hours now…in 2024 it will be protecting vaccine for 72 hours…without ice or electricity! If anything does break or gets lost, parts are easily replaceable. If you haven’t already, watch [this short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9G9pjNjopU&feature=youtu.be) to see the safety and simplicity of the Cool Cube™.

### B) Off-Site Vaccinations
#### _Supplies Ready in Mobile Cases!_
The DIY model of counting, ordering and organizing all of the supplies needed for upcoming vaccination campaigns is tiresome. Save time and streamline vaccinations with pre-packaged kits by VeriCor. With three primary sizes (500, 2500, 5000-person), these easy-to-store, simple-to-move, “just add staff and vaccine” kits can be used for seasonal off-site clinics or stored for large-scale pandemics. Already have the supplies but like our setup? Get a workstationto fit your needs (various sizes and configurations available).

### C) Alternate Care Site System
#### _Pick Care Functions — Pick Size_
Every once in a while a healthcare facility needs to expand outside of its walls. This is when an alternate care site gets deployed…maybe into a gym, maybe a superdome. Regardless of the circumstances, make sure supplies and equipment are up-to-date, compatible, and mobile. A complete VeriCor Alternate Care Site System of equipment and supplies not only enables efficient location and movement of resources (called “Response-Friendly®”), but makes management and upkeep so much easier. Curious? Call 866-469-6019 and chat with an ACS specialist today!
