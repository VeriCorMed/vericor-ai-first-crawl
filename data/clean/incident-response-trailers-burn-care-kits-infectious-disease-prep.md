#### Mobile Emergency Management
VeriCor’s GSA scheduled trailers are designed with your mobile response scenarios in mind. The initial customer consult is when the primary mission and secondary capabilities are discussed. Then leave it up to us to provide you with a trailer that can be exercised and deployed in emergency situations for years to come.
