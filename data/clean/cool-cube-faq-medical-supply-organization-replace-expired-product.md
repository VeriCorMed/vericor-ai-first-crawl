#### A Question From Your Colleagues
**Question:** “How long have you been selling the Cool Cube™?”  
  
**Answer:** 9 years. In late 2009 customers were asking about coolers for vaccine transport. They were using off-the-shelf coolers with ice packs and found it to be a pain to pack-out and not that reliable. The solution…use phase change material (PCM) that would be at the temperature of the vaccine so that no buffering material would be needed. Then use vacuum insulated panels to make sure the temperature was consistent all day long. By the spring of 2010 the first model (called the “Vaccine Transporter”) was being used by a Wisconsin health department for off-site vaccination clinics…and they loved it (this same initial model can be seen on the front cover of the CDC Vaccine Storage & Handling Toolkit). Today, the Cool Cube™ product line consists of four sizes of coolers capable of handling three different temperature configurations (fridge, freezer and controlled room temps). If you haven’t already, watch this short video to see the safety and simplicity of the Cool Cube™.

#### VeriCor Cache Conversion Process
Many times allocated emergency preparedness supplies don’t get the attention they need in order to be ready for use. Expired, unorganized, damaged, recalled…any number of things can hinder a response for when it is needed most. VeriCor’s Medical Cache Conversion process converts a mess of supplies into a ready-to-respond system that is organized and manageable, so that when an event happens care can be given.

#### You Can Do It or We Can Do It
Supply management (inventory control) of earmarked preparedness supplies can be daunting. Is equipment recalled? Are supplies expired? If you have a Response-Friendly® System, use the SmartBook™ inventory file and sort by “Expiration Date” to make sure that your product is up-to-date. Don’t have time? We have replenishment packages that range from label-and-ship to on-site service.
