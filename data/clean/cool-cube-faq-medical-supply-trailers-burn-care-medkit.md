### Cool Cube™ FAQ![Cool Cube™ FAQs](https://www.vericormed.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/cool-cube-faqs-300x200.jpg)
#### A Question From Your Colleagues
**Question:** Are the ice packs reusable?  
  
**Answer:** Yes. The various versions of Cool Cube™ phase change material (PCM) have research supporting zero thermal degradation while exposed to over 10,000 thermal cycles. That means there is a long-life ahead for this temperature controlling system.  
  
But make no mistake…the “ice packs” are not water. The specially formulated PCM inside the panels maintain a safe temperature (-21.5°C, 4.5°C, or 21.5°C) for temp sensitive products…not the 0°C/32°F that water/ice holds. Check out the short video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9G9pjNjopU&feature=youtu.be) to see just how simple the Cool Cube™ is.
