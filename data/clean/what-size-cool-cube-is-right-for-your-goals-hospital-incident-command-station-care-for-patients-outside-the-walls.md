### A) What size is right for your goals?
#### 4 sizes to choose from.
Cool Cube™ PCM coolers come in four sizes…the “03” is great for minimal product; the “08” holds as much as you will want to carry on a shoulder; the “28” wheels around for those large initiatives; and the “96” can be the backup for a whole refrigerator. But whatever size(s) you need, all have the same PCM system (for safe temperatures) and insulation system (for long hold times). Watch this short [2-minute video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9G9pjNjopU&feature=youtu.be) to see the simplicity and dependability of the Cool Cube™.

### B) Hospital Incident Command Station
#### A mobile HICS station ready for command & control!
In storage it is out of the way and takes up the space of a desk. But deploy this station anywhere to establish command and control. The front cover unclips and transforms into a table (an additional work surface). The top lid rotates up to reveal your HICS org chart and overhead light. A laptop stand rises above the inlay map/document grease board work surface to keep the technology out of the way but accessible. And having both drawers and shelves enables you to organize it the way you want. Pair it with the [HICS Support Module](https://www.vericormed.com/product/hospital-incident-command-support-module-sm-hics/) (or your own kit) and be ready to respond anytime, anywhere.

### C) Care for patients outside the walls!
#### Set up an alternate care site system anywhere.
Every once in a while a healthcare facility needs to expand outside of its walls. This is when an alternate care site gets deployed…maybe into a gym, maybe a superdome. If your emergency preparedness (EP) plan requires such readiness, make sure supplies and equipment are up-to-date, compatible, and mobile. A VeriCor Alternate Care Site System enables you to choose the care functions you want, to then supply you with the equipment and supplies you need. The Response-Friendly® approach ensures an efficient location and setup of resources while making management and upkeep easy. Curious?
