Now more than ever the transport of vaccine will be scrutinized. From simply moving a small amount of vaccine for an off-site immunization clinic, to mass relocation of vaccine in accordance to emergency management protocols—the details will be examined.
Most Vaccines for Children (VFC) program providers are aware that a good phase change material (PCM) is a much safer solution than standard ice packs. They’ve been on the hook for a number of years ensuring that publicly funded vaccine stays safe and within temperature parameters _all the time_. But now more than ever, the nursing community is picking up on the idea as well. The standard cooler with ice packs is time consuming to pack-out (not to mention “qualifying” the pack-out), requires very close attention by staff, and just doesn’t last as long as needed. Specific vaccine coolers are so much easier, fail-safe, and outperform the do-it-yourself solutions that have plagued providers for so many years.
Of course, follow your organizations current guidelines on how to safely transport vaccine. But if it’s a standard cooler with ice packs that is still being used, you may want to work hard to change the guidelines before something happens (accidental freeze/excursion). Or maybe it’s a cumbersome electrical unit that is temperamental and inconsistent. The thing is, there are purpose-built vaccine coolers that protect refrigerated vaccine from freezing while maintaining the required temperatures for 3+ days. They are called Cool Cube™ PCM coolers.
####  [**Cool Cube™ PCM Coolers**](https://www.vericormed.com/protect/)  

  * Incorporates phase change materials (now recommended by the CDC) 
    *       *         * Freeze-safe: vaccine can even be place against the PCM
        * Stable: the formulated “melting point” maintains the cooler at the specific, correct temperature
        * Consistent: the beveled edge chambers system surrounds the vaccine to eliminate cold/warm spots
  * Utilizes vacuum insulated panel (VIP) technology 
    *       *         * What’s a better insulator? NOTHING!
        * Since a VIP is on all six sides of the cooler, it can hold a consistent temperature a really long time
        * At only 1” thick, it performs as if it were four inches worth of other forms of insulation
  * Are qualified as a container and pack-out solution for vaccine and other temperature-sensitive product 
    *       *         * All models have been lab-tested
        * Varying slightly based on type (refrigerator, lab freezer, or room temp), the [Cool Cube™ 03](https://www.vericormed.com/product/cool-cube-03-at-fridge-temperatures-vt-03-vaccine-transport-cooler/) lasts three days, the [Cool Cube™ 08](https://www.vericormed.com/product/cooler-cool-cube-08-vaccine-transport-cooler-at-refrigerated-temperatures-fresh-vaccine-vt-08/) holds 3.5 days, the [Cool Cube™ 28](https://www.vericormed.com/product/cooler-cool-cube-28-vaccine-transport-cooler-at-refrigerated-temperatures-fresh-vaccine-vt-28/) for four days, and the [Cool Cube™ 96](https://www.vericormed.com/product/cool-cube-96-vaccine-transport-cooler-at-refrigerated-temperatures-for-fresh-vaccine-vt-96/) an incredible five days of temperature control in the summer heat.

Staff charged with maintaining the safety of vaccine are very busy and have a lot to do. Ensure the safety of the vaccine while simplifying the process—consider a Cool Cube™.
