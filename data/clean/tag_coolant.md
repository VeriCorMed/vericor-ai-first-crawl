Use 0° or 4.5°C Coolant?Physics 101When using a conditioned water bottle as a coolant, the bottle plateaus at 0°C until completely thawed (the basic physics is that the warm energy is absorbed by the ice to melt it). Now compare that to specialized PCM (phase-change material) which, under the same principle, plateaus at 4.5°C until [Read More](https://www.vericormed.com/physics-101-mobile-incident-command-center-storable-portable-ppe-kits/)
