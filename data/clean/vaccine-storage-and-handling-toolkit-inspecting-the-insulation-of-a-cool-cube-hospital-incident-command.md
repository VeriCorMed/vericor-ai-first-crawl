### A) Vaccine Storage and Handling Toolkit (1/11/23)
#### the latest from the CDC
A couple of weeks ago (January 11, 2023), the CDC published the new “Vaccine Storage and Handling Toolkit.” Find it [here](https://www.vericormed.com/toolkit-history/), along with all the other versions dating back to 2012.
Before meticulously studying the 70-page document, know that we will publish our always-popular “What’s Changed?” next time. It will give insight into the important (and not so necessary) changes since the last edition, so stay tuned…

### A) Inspecting the Insulation of a Cool Cube™
#### How can you tell?
The insulation of a Cool Cube™ is a critical component of its 4+ day temperature hold time. So if a decline in the performance is sensed, inspect the Temp-Shield™ Insulation System. A loose skin indicates vacuum loss (damage, puncture, leak, etc.). Without a vacuum seal, the panel(s) becomes like any other insulator and don’t hold the internal temperature as long.
