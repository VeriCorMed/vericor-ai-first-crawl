### A) Understanding Supercooling
#### New Recommendation for Lab Freezer PCM Panels
VeriCor has lowered the recommended freezer temperature for their “Lab Freezer” phase change material (PCM) panels to -30°C/-22°F, five degrees lower than the previous recommendation. Although the PCM characteristics and physical properties remain unchanged, VeriCor has adjusted the temperature required for solidifying the panels. Lab testing has revealed that the PCM used in Cool Cube™ Lab Freezer panels is susceptible to “supercooling,” a natural phenomenon in which a liquid remains in a liquid state below its freezing point. While scientists grasp the principles of supercooling, the exact reasons certain liquids can remain supercooled without freezing for extended durations are still under active research. To mitigate the risk of supercooling and ensure proper solidification of the panels, the new recommendation is to freeze the Lab Freezer PCM panels at or below -30°C/-22°F. VeriCor emphasizes that the PCM material has not undergone any changes and is still a top-quality, fully-saturated aqueous salt-based phase change material supported by reliable freeze/thaw cycling data.
