# Healthcare Emergency Preparedness Requirements
![Healthcare Emergency Preparedness Requirements](https://www.vericormed.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/prime.jpg)Healthcare providers, local health departments, emergency management agencies and healthcare coalitions **are all affected** by the recent publication of the “Final Emergency Preparedness Rule” by the CMS. Haven’t seen it yet?
  * The Federal Register webpage is [here ](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/09/16/2016-21404/medicare-and-medicaid-programs-emergency-preparedness-requirements-for-medicare-and-medicaid)(09/16/2016 official document).

Now is the time to strengthen your emergency preparedness plan for both natural and man-made disasters. Regulations go into effect November 15, 2016 and must be implemented by November 15, 2017.
