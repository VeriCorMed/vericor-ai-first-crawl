### **CUSTOM DESIGN** `  
 `
  
Each trailer is built specific to the customers need. For instance, typically customers opt for an interior height of 7′ (6″ taller than typical trailers) so that heavy medical supplies can be rolled up the ramp easier and securely stored. These are all things we think of for you.
