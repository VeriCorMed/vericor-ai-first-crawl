### B) Dependable, Temporary Beds
#### For patients and staff!
When a disaster hits, beds are some of the first things people turn to for comfort, rest and treatment. VeriCor’s line of emergency preparedness beds have a folding design for easy and compact storage, while meeting FEMA and ADA compliance standards. But more importantly they are dependable and comfortable for when they will be needed most. All beds ([& racks](https://www.vericormed.com/racks/)) are made in the USA.
