### A) Choose Your Vaccine Carrier Size
#### Small – Medium – Large – XL
VeriCor PCM coolers come in four sizes:
  * Cool Cube™ 03 is ideal for small payloads going off-site.
  * Cool Cube™ 08 holds plenty and still be over-the-shoulder.
  * Cool Cube™ 28 wheels around for more significant initiatives.
  * Cool Cube™ 96 fits a whole freezer/fridge worth of vaccine (literally).

All have the same PCM technology for a safe, consistent temperature and premium VIP insulation system for 3+ days of temperature-holding power.

### B) Rolling Workstations for Mobile Initiatives
#### Streamline operation for off-site care.
Vaccination campaigns (or any mobile medical initiative) can involve bulky supplies providers don’t want to carry around. VeriCor workstations mobilize and organize those assets so that campaigns become a breeze. From stainless steel partitioned drawers to glove holders in the lid for accessibility, these workstations are primed and ready for use.

### C) Streamline patient care…
#### at the point of the incident!
Mass casualty incidences (MCIs) can overwhelm and disrupt a healthcare network if a plan isn’t in place to expand patient treatment outside traditional walls. VeriCor’s all-in-one **Hospital Triage and Treatment System** is an intuitive, color-coordinated, mobile system of supplies that provides secondary triage and definitive treatment for a surge of 100 patients. Managers like it because it’s easy to maintain, and responders like it because it can deploy anywhere.
