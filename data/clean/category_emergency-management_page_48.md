Moving Vaccine & BloodOne Way to Maintain the Cold ChainWhen transporting vaccines/blood (for off-site use, temporary relocation, contingency plan activation, etc.), there is one rule…the cold chain must be maintained! When the cold chain is broken, lives are at stake, and at the very least, hundreds of dollars wasted. Don’t leave the cold chain to [Read More](https://www.vericormed.com/one-way-maintain-cold-chain-system-mci-response-go-supply-management/)

Use 0° or 4.5°C Coolant?Physics 101When using a conditioned water bottle as a coolant, the bottle plateaus at 0°C until completely thawed (the basic physics is that the warm energy is absorbed by the ice to melt it). Now compare that to specialized PCM (phase-change material) which, under the same principle, plateaus at 4.5°C until [Read More](https://www.vericormed.com/physics-101-mobile-incident-command-center-storable-portable-ppe-kits/)
