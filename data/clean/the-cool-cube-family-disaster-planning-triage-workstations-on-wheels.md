### “Failure to plan is planning to fail.”
This popular quote by Benjamin Franklin reflects what emergency preparedness is all about…preventing or mitigating disaster. Without adequate planning, equipment and supplies, the most basic response to a disaster will be to simply rescue the victims and transfer them to a hospital facility (“scoop and run” emergency medicine). This will result in the transfer of the problem from the incident site to the hospital, overwhelming and disrupting the care capacity of the health facility. A VeriCor Triage & Treatment System can change that problem.

#### Make a big difference in your EP
Front-line physicians and nurses are used to workstations. So when a disaster happens, why not have a mobile workstation ready to go with supplies? It can be moved between patients. It will optimize workflow and productivity in times of crisis. It will better facilitate patient care. It will greatly enhance the emergency preparedness infrastructure.
