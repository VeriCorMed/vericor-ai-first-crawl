### A) Emerging Trends on the Preparedness Landscape
#### Inside Scoop – The Preview Report
NACCHO released a [preview report](https://www.naccho.org/uploads/downloadable-resources/2022PrepProfile-PREVIEWREPORT.pdf) ahead of the 2023 Preparedness Summit, which we had the opportunity to attend, and had a workshop highlighting the results of this report. The report offers a concise overview of the significant findings extracted from the 2022 Preparedness Profile, covering many critical subjects related to local preparedness. Serving as an educational resource, this report delves into the emerging trends and issues observed at the local, state, and national levels. A comprehensive report is scheduled for release later this summer. For direct access to this NACCHO publication, click the image.

#### Unleash the Power of the Mobile HICS Station!
Establish command and control using a mobile HICS (Hospital Incident Command System) station. This compact unit can conveniently store and occupies the space equivalent to a desk. Once deployed, it transforms into a versatile multi-tool featuring a power management system, table, organizational chart, overhead light, laptop stand, inlay map/document grease board, and multiple drawers and shelves for efficient supply organization. Enhance its capabilities by pairing it with the [HICS Support Module](https://www.vericormed.com/product/hospital-incident-command-support-module-sm-hics/) or your own kit, ensuring readiness for prompt response in any location.
