### A) New Wave of COVID-19 — Are You Ready?
#### Here’s what you can do to prepare.
The next wave is coming (BA.2, a subvariant of Omicron). Besides the people tracker, the CDC also has [wastewater surveillance data](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#wastewater-surveillance) used for the early detection of COVID-19 within a community. In essence, they measure the amount of the virus in the wastewater to see if levels are increasing or decreasing. Experts advise taking more precautions as you see positive test rates start to rise above 5 percent.
In addition to paying attention to indicators, some other things to think about are:
  * Have high-quality masks on hand—the more people who wear masks correctly, the sooner the wave will be over.
  * Get COVID testing supplies when the weather is cooler—supplies can be damaged from sitting in hot summer weather during transit.
  * Integrate Cool Cube™ PCM coolers into contingency and transport plans—be ready for off-site initiatives and power outages.
  * Create backup plans—it almost goes without saying, but COVID has proven to ruin even the best planning. Have a backup to the backup.

### A) Prepping for the Next Wave
#### Different sizes for different tasks.
The ebbs and flows of this pandemic/endemic show signs that it will be with us for a while. Now is the time to develop the infrastructure, including the coolers/transporters needed, to maintain the vaccine cold chain year-round. Cool Cube™ PCM coolers come in four sizes. So whether it’s the light, over-the-shoulder coolers for off-site initiatives or large-capacity rolling units for backup, get what is needed now.
