### A) Introducing the Cool Ball™
#### Rounding Out Our Cold Chain Innovation!
At VeriCor, we continually push the boundaries of cold chain technology. Today, we’re thrilled to announce our latest breakthrough: the Cool Ball™! You love the reliable temperature control of our Cool Cube™, but let’s be honest, sometimes corners just aren’t efficient enough. That’s why our engineers have been working diligently to develop a spherical solution that provides unparalleled rolling capabilities. Imagine effortlessly transporting temperature-sensitive materials – give the Cool Ball™ a gentle push and watch it navigate any terrain! Key features include:
  * **Effortless Mobility** – say goodbye to lifting and hello to rolling!
  * **Aerodynamic Design** – optimized transport efficiency (and perhaps a bit of fun).
  * **Optional Cat Toy Attachment** – why not?

Pre-orders are open now! Visit www.aprilfools.com to secure your Cool Ball™ before they roll out of stock.
Happy April Fools’ Day!
