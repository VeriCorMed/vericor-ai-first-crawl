### B) Empowering Healthcare Resilience
#### Unlock the Potential of Alternate Care Sites
Alternate Care Sites (ACSs) are indispensable to healthcare emergency and disaster preparedness. In moments of crisis, be it a natural disaster, pandemic, or other emergency, the demand for healthcare services can swiftly surpass available resources. ACSs step in as vital extensions, providing additional patient care areas and beds to alleviate overcrowding in our fixed facilities. This ensures every patient can access the care they require, even in the most challenging circumstances. If ACS planning and implementation is part of your comprehensive disaster preparedness strategy, check out more on VeriCor’s Alternate Care Sites by clicking the picture/button below or calling 608-526-6901 to speak with an experienced staff member today. Your preparedness is our priority!

### C) Mobilizing Excellence
#### Vericor’s Innovative Mobile Emergency Room System
Forward Surgical Teams (FSTs) serve as agile, mobile surgical units delivering advanced medical care in the United States Army. These teams are pivotal in providing critical support within the crucial “golden hour” following injuries, especially during mass casualty incidents. VeriCor has taken inspiration from this concept and transformed it into a mobile emergency room system tailored for healthcare coalition preparedness. We meticulously designed our mobile units to offer a comprehensive and adaptable solution for various medical emergencies.
