Learn | Practice | Improve
### A) Bookmark It!
#### The best website for anything related to vaccines.
(No, it’s not our website—yet.) If you haven’t already, bookmark Immunization Action Coalition’s immunize.org for everything related to vaccines, including storage and handling. The amount of information provided there is amazing and it’s updated frequently. I particularly like the “Technically Speaking” section; a monthly article by Dr. Deborah Wexler, the Executive Director of IAC. If you deal with vaccines, you will find something there worthwhile. Bookmark it!

### A) Response-Friendly® Medical Kits
#### For immediate, organized, care-specific patient care.
VeriCor MedKits are organized and ready for field operations. The correct supplies are organized within a portable, rolled-up, quick-to-deploy [UMO](https://www.vericormed.com/product/upright-medical-organizer-mc-umo-medical-roll-pack/). In the field, medical personnel can see contents within the pockets to facilitate faster treatment. Back at home, easily manage inventory with the included data-driven SmartBook™. Choose from a wide range of pre-built MedKits ([Airway](https://www.vericormed.com/product/airway-management-medical-kit-module-mk-am/), [Burn Care](https://www.vericormed.com/product/burn-care-medical-kit-module-mk-bc/), [Examination](https://www.vericormed.com/product/examination-medkit-mk-e/), [IV Therapy](https://www.vericormed.com/product/intravenous-therapy-medical-kit-module-mk-it/), [Med Admin](https://www.vericormed.com/product/medication-administration-medical-kit-module-mk-ma/), [PPE](https://www.vericormed.com/product/staff-personal-protective-equipment-medkit-mk-sppe/), [Surgical](https://www.vericormed.com/product/surgical-medical-kit-module-mk-sg/), [Wound Care](https://www.vericormed.com/product/wound-care-medical-kit-module-mk-wc/), and more), or have one customized for your needs.

### B) Alternate Care Site (ACS) System
#### A system of equipment and supplies ready for a disaster.
To expand treatment outside the walls, you will need the right supplies and equipment on hand. VeriCor Alternate Care Site Systems already have that covered. You pick the type of treatment required, and a system is built to your specs that is ready for deployment. The Response-Friendly® philosophy ensures your patients will get care quickly.

### C) An emergency room in a tent?
#### Great for hospital coalition emergency preparedness.
FSTs (Forward Surgical Teams) are small, mobile surgical units in the United States Army. VeriCor revamped the concept into a mobile emergency room system specifically for health care coalitions. It supports advanced levels of care typically needed within the “golden hour” of injury during mass causality incidents.
