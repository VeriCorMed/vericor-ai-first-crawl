#### Care-Specific Medical Kits for EP
More advanced than a first aid kit, VeriCor MedKits contain treatment-specific supplies that are organized within a portable, rolled-up, quick-to-deploy UMO (Upright Medical Organizer). When in a pinch, the responding providers have exact locations of the supplies (bag # and pocket) to facilitate a more effective response. Choose from a wide range of pre-built MedKits, or customize your own today.

### Cool Cube™ FAQ![The Impact of Data Loggers](https://www.vericormed.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/The-Impact-of-Data-Loggers-300x200.jpg)
#### A Question from Your Colleagues
**Question:** Can the Cool Cube™ be taken on a plane (used for overseas travel)?  
  
**Answer:** Yes. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) here in the United States allows medically necessary equipment and supplies on board an airplane after they have been screened. So whether used for general transport (1-2 hours), back-up redundancy, or off-site initiatives (even out of the country), the Cool Cube™ is an excellent piece of equipment that manages the cold chain without the use of ice (which can be too cold) or electricity (which can break down).

### Patient Surge System![Storable MCI Response](https://www.vericormed.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Storable-MCI-Response-300x200.jpg)
#### Effective Medical Surge EP
Preparation for a medical surge is imperative for a hospital to respond effectively. Facilities that plan to operate for 96 hours without supplies/support from outside the region are considered ready. But to get to that operational readiness it takes a lot more than just a stockpile of supplies and a list. Space issues, staff/personnel issues, and supply organization are all part of the equation. A complete VeriCor Alternate Care Site System of equipment and supplies not only enable efficient location and movement of resources (called “Response-Friendly®”), but make management and upkeep a breeze with the exclusive SmartBook™. Check out VeriCor’s unique, 25-bed, 96-hour scalable Alternate Care Site System.
