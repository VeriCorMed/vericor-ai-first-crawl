### A) Inspecting a Vacuum Insulation Panel System
#### Make sure your insulation is still effective.
The insulation of a Cool Cube™ is a key component of its 4+ day temperature hold time. So if ever you notice a decline in the performance, inspect the Temp-Shield™ Insulation System. A loose skin (click the picture to see an example) or a soft, squishy feel indicates vacuum loss (damage, puncture, leak, etc.), and then it’s like any other insulator which means a shorter hold time. The good news if you have this problem? Replacement parts are [available here](https://www.vericormed.com/small-medium-large-cool-cube-components/).
Watch this [113-second explainer video](https://youtu.be/N9G9pjNjopU) to see the simplicity and effectiveness of Cool Cube™ PCM Coolers.
