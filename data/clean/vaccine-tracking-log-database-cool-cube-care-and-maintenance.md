### A) Vaccine Tracking Log Database
#### Please Share 🙏
There are many variations of vaccine temperature tracking logs, with no compiled database for ideas. You can help change that! If not proprietary, please share the form your entity uses to log vaccine temperatures by emailing them to support@vericormed.com (personal/entity identification will be removed before sharing). As logs get received, they will be uploaded to a dedicated webpage that anyone can access, helping others like you in the future. Here is a [Temp Tracking Log](https://www.vericormed.com/?wpfb_dl=732) created by VeriCor staff.

### C) Expanded Advanced Levels of Care
#### Mobile Emergency Room
FSTs (Forward Surgical Teams) are small, mobile surgical units in the United States Army.

It supports advanced levels of care typically needed within the “golden hour” of injury during mass causality incidents.
