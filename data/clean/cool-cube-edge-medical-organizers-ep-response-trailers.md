#### A Foolproof System
Cool Cubes™ have the edge when it comes to temperature sensitive transport:  

  * The extremely effective Surround-Care™ Insulation system has a patented edge abutment assembly process to increase resistance to abrasion and impact.
  * The passive cooling system is comprised of PCM made from vegetable sources, which has the edge on other paraffin-based variations (vegetable-based PCMs are renewable, biodegradable, less expensive).
  * The passive cooling panels have a 45° beveled edge that enable it to fit with the other panels to form a chamber that completely and efficiently surrounds the payload (also making it foolproof during pack-out).
