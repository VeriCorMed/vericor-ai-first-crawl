### A) Unlimited Possibilities: 3 temps — 4 sizes
#### A breakdown of the model number.
The Cool Cube™ model number indicates the temp AND size of the cooler. VT/BT stands for vaccine/blood transport (so at refrigerator temps). FT stands for frozen transport (so at freezer temps). RT stands for controlled room temperature transport. On the backend, the numbering system follows suit with the liters of pack-out space available. The “03” is an easy tote to throw over your shoulder. The “08” is a bit larger, but not too much to carry. The “28” enters into the “towable” realm with wheels and a flip-out pull handle. The “96” is the largest of the Cool Cubes™ and can handle a refrigerator (or freezer) worth of product; again, on wheels. Plus, with a quick swap of the panels, every Cool Cube™ can go from holding refrigerator temps to lab freezer temps in an instant.

### B) Vaccination Systems—Just add staff & vaccine!
#### Mobile systems that come ready to use.
The masses are coming! Save time and streamline your upcoming vaccinations with prepackaged kits from VeriCor. The easy-to-store, simple-to-move, “just add staff & vaccine” packages come in three sizes ([500](https://www.vericormed.com/product/vaccinator-500-go-bag-vaccination-module-vs-500gb/), [2500](https://www.vericormed.com/product/vaccinator-2500-go-system-vaccination-module-vs-2500gs/), [5000-person](https://www.vericormed.com/product/vaccinator-5000-system-with-refrigerator-vaccination-module-vs-5000r/)). The smaller kits are ideal for smaller clinics, while the larger “systems” are ready to vaccinate the masses. Already have the supplies but like the setup? Buy a [Go-Bag](https://www.vericormed.com/product/go-bag-bag/) or [workstation](https://www.vericormed.com/mobile-medical-workstations/) to make your own vaccination campaign system. And although some of these systems may be “Out of Stock”, we are diligently working with the suppliers to get the lead time back to normal—so get in line.
**NOTE: three of the[VS-5000R (in Violet Blue)](https://www.vericormed.com/product/vaccinator-5000-system-with-refrigerator-vaccination-module-vs-5000r/) are ready to ship now! Call 608-526-6901 to see if it’s still available!**
