### No More Ruined Product[![No More Ruined Product](https://www.vericormed.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/No-More-Ruined-Product.jpg)](https://www.vericormed.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/No-More-Ruined-Product.jpg)
#### Consistent Temps w/o Electricity
If refrigerators or freezers loose power, temperatures quickly skyrocket. If a compressor or condenser coils stop working, temperatures quickly skyrocket. If ice is used, temperatures hover around 0°C…good for beverages but not for life-saving frozen or fridge product. That is why we make and sell Cool Cube™ phase change material (PCM) coolers. They are passive (don’t depend on electricity), they are ice-free (the PCM is engineered for an exact temperature range), and they are long-lasting (days of use without any attention). Simply put, our goal is to eliminate product waste due to temperature excursions (after power outages, throughout transport, during off-site initiatives, etc.)!

### Convert the Mess…Easily[![Convert a Cache into a System](https://www.vericormed.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Convert-a-Cache-into-a-System-300x200.jpg)](https://www.vericormed.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Convert-a-Cache-into-a-System.jpg)
#### Preparedness Supplies Made Ready
Expired? Organized? Recalled? If something happened today, is a warehoused cache of equipment and supplies ready to deliver medical care? VeriCor’s Medical Cache Conversion process converts a mess of supplies into a ready-to-respond system that is organized and manageable. That mess of supplies can be turned into a Response-Friendly® System. So make the easy choice and divert preparedness dollars towards getting your already procured assets ready for a disaster!

#### Make Preparedness Supplies Usable
Supply management (inventory control) of earmarked preparedness product can be daunting. Is equipment recalled? Are supplies expired? If you have a Response-Friendly® System, use the SmartBook™ inventory file and sort by “Expiration Date” to make sure that your product is up-to-date. Don’t have time? We understand. That’s why we have replenishment packages that range from label-and-ship to on-site service.
