### A) An All-in-One Solution for the Cold Chain
#### Transport, back-up, off-site, and more.
In many cases, Cool Cube™ PCM Coolers are purchased to serve a variety of purposes. The first and most obvious use is to transport sensitive product from point A to point B. But then many times, that point B is an off-site clinic at which they use them as temporary fridges or freezers (2nd purpose). And since they work well at holding that specific fridge or freezer temp, the third use is as a back-up fridge or freezer for when the power goes out. One product…so many uses!

### B) The Problem’s Solution
#### TMDs (Temperature Monitoring Devices)
Failure to monitor/regulate the temperature of a storage unit can be costly and problematic. TMDs can eliminate this problem. The CDC recommends the use of a specific type of TMD known as a Digital Data Logger (DDL) for continuous temperature monitoring and recording. Besides being more accurate, a DDL:
  * streamlines readings–with a programmable logging interval,
  * eliminates constant logging–downloads tell the story,
  * notifies when out-of-range temperatures occur–audible and visual alarms.
