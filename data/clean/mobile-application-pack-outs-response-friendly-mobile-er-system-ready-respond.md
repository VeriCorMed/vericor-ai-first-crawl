#### Mobile Application Pack-Outs
“How many gel packs do I need?”  
Answer: **None**   
Cool Cubes™ have thin panels that are at the “sweet spot” of the desired temperature range (4°C, 20°C, or -20°C). These panels, combined with outstanding insulation, will keep product cool (or warm) for days! No other gel packs, ice bottles or electricity needed. They stay cool…they look cool…they have the shape of a cube…they are easy to use…that’s why they’re called Cool Cubes™.

### FST System for Healthcare[![Mobile ER Field Setup](https://www.vericormed.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Mobile-ER-Field-Setup-300x165.png)](https://www.vericormed.com/mobile-emergency-room/)
#### Response-Friendly® Mobile ER
FSTs (Forward Surgical Teams) are small, mobile surgical units in the United States Army. With some rethinking and hard work, VeriCor retooled the FST concept into a system for health care emergency preparedness — the Response-Friendly® Mobile Emergency Room (ER). This system supports advanced levels of care typically needed within the “golden hour” of injury. Be ready when disaster strikes with this complete, efficient, and simple patient surge system.

#### A System Ready to Respond
The last Mobile Army Surgical Hospital (MASH) unit was deactivated 11 years ago and converted into a combat support hospital (one of our directors helped with that conversion/training). Not long after, VeriCor developed its first ACS system — a fast and efficient mobile medical system specifically for health care preparedness. This innovative concept was refined to be more complete, yet simpler than its MASH/CSH predecessors. Check out what is now known as a Response-Friendly® Alternate Care Site (ACS) System — the gold standard for patient surge preparedness.
