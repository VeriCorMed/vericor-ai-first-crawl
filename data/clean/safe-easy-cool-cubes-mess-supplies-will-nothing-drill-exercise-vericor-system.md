#### Safe & Easy Cool Cubes™
  
FAQ: **Can Cool Cubes™ be opened?**  
Answer: **Yes**   
  
This past summer a VT-100 was logged as being opened 56 times over 82 hours. No ice, no electricity, and the product inside stayed between 3° and 8°C the entire time. Its cooling panels were “conditioned” in a regular refrigerator (2°C for 12 hours) and then immediately used for product pack-out…which took less than 2 minutes. But it’s not only about how easy it was…it’s also about how safe it was! The cooling panels never dropped below 3°C and had an average temperature of 5.6°C. Those are safe numbers…much safer and easier than ice bottles would have been.
