#### Certification in Infection Control
`  
 `
`  
 `Local Health Departments (LHDs) are increasingly crucial in safeguarding public health through effective infection control practices. To bolster LHD capacity in this critical area, NACCHO, in collaboration with the CDC, is pleased to announce its 2024 Scholarship Opportunity. This initiative financially supports current LHD staff in pursuing the prestigious Certification in Infection Control (CIC) or the Associate-Infection Prevention and Control (a-IPC) credential. Selected LHDs will receive up to $5,000 in reimbursements for exam fees and approved study materials. This will empower their staff to enhance their expertise and contribute to more substantial community-level infection prevention efforts. Applications for this valuable scholarship program are open until January 26, 2024. We encourage LHDs to visit [THIS LINK](https://www.naccho.org/blog/articles/2024-certification-in-infection-control-scholarship-opportunity-for-local-health-departments) to learn more and apply.
