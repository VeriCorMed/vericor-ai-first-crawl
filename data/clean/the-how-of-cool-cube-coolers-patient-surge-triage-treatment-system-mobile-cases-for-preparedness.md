### A) The “How” of Cool Cube™ Coolers
#### For vaccine, medicine, blood products, FFP and more.
Every Cool Cube™ is so simple and reliable that many people ask “how?”
1. Finely tuned phase change material (PCM) surrounds your product with the same temperature that your product is at. No ice (which is too cold) or electricity (not always available; has moving parts).
2. Vacuum insulated panels are only 1-inch thick (all 6 sides), but prevent heat transfer as if they were 7 inches thick (of polystyrene).
With these two technologies working together, Cool Cube™ Coolers can’t be beat!
If you haven’t already, watch this [113-second explainer video](https://youtu.be/N9G9pjNjopU) to see the simplicity and effectiveness of Cool Cube™ PCM Coolers.

### B) Patient Surge Triage & Treatment System
#### An ideal response in times of crisis.
Mass casualty incidences (MCIs) can overwhelm and disrupt a healthcare network if a system is not available to expand patient treatment outside of traditional walls. VeriCor’s all-in-one Triage and Treatment System is an intuitive, color-coordinated, mobile cache of supplies that provides secondary triage and definitive treatment for a surge of 100 patients. Managers like it because it’s easy to maintain. Responders like it because it can deploy anywhere with the right supplies in the right place. See the system in action ([YouTube video here](https://youtu.be/Xo_hfT2JOaY)) and then call 608-526-6901 to speak with a specialist.
