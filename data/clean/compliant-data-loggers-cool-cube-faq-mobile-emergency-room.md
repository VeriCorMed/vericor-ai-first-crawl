### Cool Cube™ FAQ[![Cool Cube™ Passive Technology](https://www.vericormed.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/cool-cube-passive-technology-300x200.jpg)](https://www.vericormed.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/cool-cube-passive-technology.jpg)
#### A Question from Your Colleagues
**Question:** What does “passive technology” mean?  
  
**Answer:** Cool Cubes™ are often categoriezed as “passive technology.” Simply put, Cool Cubes™ do not need an internal power source to work. Instead they rely on phase change material (PCM) coupled with high-performance vacuum insulation technology to maintain needed temperatures. This technology is as simple, safe, effective and portable as you can get. Watch just how simple the Cool Cube™ system is in this short [2-minute video (click here).](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9G9pjNjopU&feature=youtu.be)

This system supports advanced levels of care typically needed within the “golden hour” of injury. Be ready when disaster strikes with this complete, efficient and simple patient surge system.
