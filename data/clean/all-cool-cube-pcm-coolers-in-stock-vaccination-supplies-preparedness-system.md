### B) Vaccination Supplies – Ready When You Are!
#### Just add staff and vaccine.
Save time and streamline upcoming vaccinations with prepackaged kits from VeriCor. The easy-to-store, simple-to-move, “just add staff & vaccine” packages come in three sizes ([500](https://www.vericormed.com/product/vaccinator-500-go-bag-vaccination-module-vs-500gb/), [2500](https://www.vericormed.com/product/vaccinator-2500-go-system-vaccination-module-vs-2500gs/), [5000-person](https://www.vericormed.com/product/vaccinator-5000-system-with-refrigerator-vaccination-module-vs-5000r/)). The smaller kits are ideal for smaller clinics, while the larger “systems” are ready to vaccinate the masses.
Already have the supplies but like the setup? Buy a [Go-Bag](https://www.vericormed.com/product/go-bag-bag/) or [workstation](https://www.vericormed.com/mobile-medical-workstations/) to make your vaccination campaign system.

### C) When your current supplies…
#### …can be part of a preparedness system.
Sometimes emergency preparedness supplies are forgotten or not given attention until it is too late. Expired, unorganized, damaged, and recalled assets will hinder a response, and that’s where we can help. The Medical Cache Conversion process converts a mess of supplies into a ready-to-respond system that is organized & manageable. Ensure that when a mass causality incident (MCI) happens, your supplies are ready. Call (608) 526-6901 today to speak with a cache conversion specialist.
