### A) Lab-Driven Optimization
#### Lab Freezer PCM Panel Guidelines
Guided by rigorous lab testing, a couple of years ago, we refined our freezing recommendation for Lab Freezer PCM panels to -30°C/-22°F. This adjustment addressed the scientific phenomenon of supercooling to ensure that customers got consistent and reliable Lab Freezer temperature panel solidification. If this is your first time hearing about it, check out our blog post, “[Understanding Supercooling](https://www.vericormed.com/understanding-supercooling-vericor-modifies-lab-freezer-pcm-panel-freezing-temperature-to-30c-22f/),” for a not-so-scientific explanation of this unique phenomenon.
