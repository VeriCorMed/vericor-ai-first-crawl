### Features of the EZ Hang System™
  1. **D-Rings for Secure Attachments:** The integrated D-rings are perfect for attaching the UMO to e-track systems commonly found in airplanes, disaster utility vehicles (DUVs), and other transport vehicles. This ensures the organizer remains securely in place during transit or in mobile medical settings.
  2. **Adjustable Clipping Straps:** The adjustable straps provide the flexibility to attach the UMO to a variety of structures, including shelter frames, poles, and other vertical supports. These straps ensure that the organizer can be deployed in temporary medical facilities, outdoor shelters, or even unconventional environments.
  3. **J-Shaped Hangers for Versatile Placement:** The j-shaped hangers are designed to fit seamlessly over doors, providing a sturdy and reliable hanging option. Additionally, these hangers are compatible with our custom-made Portable Stand (MC-SUMO), which is sold separately. This stand enhances the versatility of the EZ Hang System™ by allowing it to be deployed in any location, regardless of available infrastructure.
