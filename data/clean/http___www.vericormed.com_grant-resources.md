### Grant-Funded Solutions from VeriCor
Did you know that many of VeriCor’s products were specifically designed to align with grant funding opportunities? At VeriCor, we understand that obtaining the right resources for your facility often depends on navigating the complex world of funding and grants. That’s why we prioritize designing solutions that meet the unique requirements outlined in these funding opportunities, helping you make the most of your budget while enhancing emergency preparedness and response capabilities.
#### Supporting Hospitals Through HPP Grants
The Hospital Preparedness Program (HPP), managed by the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response (ASPR), is the only federal funding program dedicated exclusively to improving the emergency preparedness and response capabilities of hospitals and healthcare systems. This program provides grants to support the development of healthcare coalitions and ensures that hospitals can handle large-scale emergencies effectively.

#### Enhancing Readiness for Veterans Affairs Facilities

While specific grant opportunities may not always be listed, the VA provides comprehensive guidance on ensuring continuity of operations and emergency readiness for veterans’ healthcare facilities.
