The Traceable® Fridge/Freezer Temperature Monitoring Kit (TM-5650) reliably monitors the temperature and alerts you of excursions without opening the door/container. This calibrated digital thermometer has a detachable, GRAS, glycol-encased probe (recommended by the CDC) to insulate the readings from rapid temperature changes (i.e. when a door is opened). The integrated alarm bar lights up and buzzes if an excursion occurs (the alarm light also glows orange within 1 degree of alarm settings). The triple display simultaneously shows minimum, maximum, and current temperatures for effective monitoring. VeriCor is a proud distributor of Traceable® products. Base unit, probe, certificate, flip-open stand, Velcro®, magnetic back, batteries, and quick start guide included.

### Routing a Corded Probe through the Cool Cube™ 03
The Cool Cube™ 03 has clear plastic, external pockets for holding a temperature monitor (or other things) during use. When using a device with a corded probe, here’s how you can do it:
  1. After packing out the product, place the probe within the chamber as if it were the product.
  2. Route the cord to a corner of the Cool Cube™, where the panels meet.
  3. Place the last PCM panel on top to complete the chamber.
  4. Close the lid of the Cool Cube™
  5. Zip the two zippers around the cord where it comes out
  6. Plug the cord into the temperature monitor and place it in a pocket of the Cool Cube™.

**Best Practice: Condition the probe to the target temperature before integrating it into the Cool Cube™ chamber.

### Routing a Corded Probe through the Cool Cube™ 28
The Cool Cube™ 28 is equipped with an elastic, external pocket to hold a temperature monitor (or other things) during use. When using a device with a corded probe, here’s how you can do it:
  1. After packing out the product, place the probe in the chamber with the product.
  2. Next, route the cord to the center, front of the Cool Cube™. (If you have not disconnected the cord from the device, do so now.)
  3. Take the plug end of the cord and slide it down between the insulation panel and outer wall of the case about 3” to the black flexible grommet.
  4. Push the plug end of the cord through the flexible grommet (from the inside out).
     * The design allows for the grommet to be removed or possibly popped out during this process. Route the cord through the grommet and re-insert if necessary.
  5. Place the last PCM panel on top to complete the chamber.
  6. Plug the cord into the temperature monitor and place it in the pocket of the Cool Cube™.
  7. Close the lid of the Cool Cube™.

One moment of caution here. Routing a cord through the open lid and not utilizing the grommet hole will likely inhibit the lid from closing completely and could damage or sever the cord when closing the lid.
**Best Practice: Condition the probe to the target temperature before integrating it into the Cool Cube™ chamber.

### Routing a Corded Probe through the Cool Cube™96
The Cool Cube™ 96 is equipped with an elastic, external pocket to hold a temperature monitor (or other things) during use. When using a device with a corded probe, here’s how you can do it:
  1. Slide out the front PCM panel being careful not to disturb the product arrangement.**Be cautious of rings/jewelry on this next step.**
  2. Place the probe within the chamber as if it were the product. Route the cord to the center, front of the Cool Cube™. (If you have not disconnected the cord from the device, do so now.)
  3. Slide a hand between the outer case and front Styrofoam insulation to create about 1” of space, the front vacuum insulated panel will flex slightly.
  4. Take the plug end of the cord and slide it down between the foam and outer wall of the case about 2” to the black flexible grommet.
     * The design allows for the grommet to be removed or possibly popped out during this process. Route the cord through the grommet and re-insert if necessary. 
  5. Push the plug end of the cord through the flexible grommet, from the inside out.
  6. Replace the front PCM panel and place the final panel on top to complete the chamber.
  7. Plug the cord into the temperature monitor and place it in the pocket of the Cool Cube™.
  8. Close the lid of the Cool Cube™.

One moment of caution here. Routing a cord through the open lid and not utilizing the grommet hole will likely inhibit the lid from closing completely and could damage or sever the cord when closing the lid.
**Best Practice: Condition the probe to the target temperature before integrating it into the Cool Cube™ chamber.

### **Basic Monitoring Specific FAQ**
[ L Does the TM-4127 log data?  ](https://www.vericormed.com/product/traceable-temperature-monitoring-kit-tm-5650/)
No. However, it does show high/low readings and meanwhile alarms can be set to signal out of range conditions.

[ l How long is a calibration certificate good for?  ](https://www.vericormed.com/product/traceable-temperature-monitoring-kit-tm-5650/)
New units come with a calibration due date of 2 years from the date of manufacture. However, inventorying such products sometimes cuts into this time period weeks or months. We guarantee a calibration due date of at least 1 year past the purchase date.
[ l As Found vs As Left  ](https://www.vericormed.com/product/traceable-temperature-monitoring-kit-tm-5650/)
When recalibrating your measurement device, you have the option to receive data as “**As Found** “, “**As Left** “, or both.
**AS FOUND** calibration data is calibration data acquired prior to any repairs or adjustments being made to the device. Essentially, it is the condition of the device “as found” when arriving to our facility for calibration. This provides the user an opportunity to ensure that the instrument was reading accurately, and within specification, while it was in use. It offers valuable information and documentation to support an end user’s test results, and it also provides record-keeping on the instrument’s long-term linearity and stability.
**AS LEFT** calibration data is calibration data acquired after any repairs or adjustments are made to the device, i.e. the condition the device was left before shipping back to you. The condition of the device used to acquire the as left data will be the same condition in which you will receive your device.

  * If tax-exempt, a valid tax exemption certificate is needed to process the order.

Brokerage: the fee associated with customs clearance for your inbound shipments. 
  * Paid by the “Importer of Record” (customer) based on the value of the shipment to the designated broker.
  * Broker can be identified by the customer prior to shipment (so they use their own), otherwise FedEx will be the default broker.
  * There are ways to avoid broker fees, but there’s time and work involved ([example](https://www.theartofdoingstuff.com/how-to-avoid-broker-fees-just-in-time-for-online-xmas-shopping/)).
