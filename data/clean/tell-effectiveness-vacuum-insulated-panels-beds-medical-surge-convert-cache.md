#### How to Tell Effectiveness
After 5 years, Cool Cube™ vacuum insulated panels lose approximately 5% effectiveness (i.e. a [Cool Cube™ 420](https://www.vericormed.com/product/cooler-cool-cube-420-vaccine-transport-cooler-at-refrigerator-temperatures-fresh-vaccine-vt-420/) protects refrigerator temp vaccine for 103+ hours; in 2023 it will only protect 97+ hours). But just in case you are wondering if the insulation in your Cool Cube™ is still good (we have been selling Cool Cubes™ for 9 years), inspect each panel for a loss of rigidity. A loose skin indicates vacuum loss (puncture/leak), which will affect performance. [Click the image](https://www.vericormed.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/How-to-Tell-Effectiveness-of-Vacuum-Insulated-Panels.jpg) for a close up view…can you see the difference? They are durable, but not indestructible, so replacement panels are available.
