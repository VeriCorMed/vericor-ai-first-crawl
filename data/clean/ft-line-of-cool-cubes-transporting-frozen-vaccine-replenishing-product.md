### A) Normal Freezer = “FT” Line of Cool Cubes™
#### Pfizer and Moderna both can be put in the Cool Cube™
The CDC and FDA announced that it is allowing undiluted frozen vials of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine to be transported and stored at conventional temperatures commonly found in pharmaceutical freezers for a period of up to two weeks. This is good news for those wanting to use Cool Cube™ PCM (phase change material) coolers (see next section).

### A) Ideal for Storing/Transporting Frozen Vaccine
#### As you can imagine, it’s a popular line right now.
If you didn’t realize, the Cool Cube™ at Lab Freezer Temps is already a prequalified container and pack-out system ideal for storing/transporting frozen vaccine for 60+ hours without using ice, electricity, or dry ice.

### C) Turn a Mess into a System!
#### It’s as easy as just contacting us!
Sometimes emergency preparedness supplies are forgotten. Expired, unorganized, damaged, recalled…any number of things can hinder a response. The Medical Cache Conversion process converts a mess of supplies into a ready-to-respond system that is organized & manageable. Make sure that when a mass causality incident (MCI) happens, your supplies are ready. Call (608) 526-6901 today to speak with a cache conversion specialist.
