#### COVID-19 Vaccine Storage & Handling Addendum
In our September 21 newsletter, we had a “Quick Guide to Important Temps and Times” for the major vaccines (with links to their literature). Not long after, the CDC published an addendum to the 2021 Vaccine Storage and Handling Toolkit covering their recommendations for each. Be sure to check it out if you haven’t already: [2021 Toolkit + Addendum (p. 49-64)](https://www.vericormed.com/?wpfb_dl=500).

### C) A mess of supplies…
#### …can turn into a system!
Sometimes emergency preparedness supplies are forgotten or not given attention until it is too late. Expired, unorganized, damaged, and recalled assets will hinder a response. That’s where we can help. The Medical Cache Conversion process converts a mess of supplies into a ready-to-respond system that is organized & manageable. Make sure that when a mass causality incident (MCI) happens, your supplies are ready. Call (608) 526-6901 today to speak with a cache conversion specialist.
