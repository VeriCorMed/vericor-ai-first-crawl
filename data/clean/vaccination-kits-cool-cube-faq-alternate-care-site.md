### The VACCINATOR Line  
Supplies that are Ready-to-Go
The DIY model of counting, ordering and organizing all of the supplies needed for upcoming vaccination campaigns is tiresome. Save time and look more professional with pre-packaged kits by VeriCor. With three primary sizes ([500](https://www.vericormed.com/product/vaccinator-500-go-bag-vaccination-module-vs-500gb/), [2500](https://www.vericormed.com/product/vaccinator-2500-go-system-vaccination-module-vs-2500gs/), [5000-person](https://www.vericormed.com/product/vaccinator-5000-system-with-refrigerator-vaccination-module-vs-5000r/)), these easy-to-store, simple-to-move, “just add staff and vaccine” kits can be used for seasonal off-site clinics or stored for large-scale pandemics. Already have the supplies but like our setup? Get a workstation to fit your needs (various sizes and configurations available).

### Cool Cube™ FAQ[![Do I need to use all six panels](https://www.vericormed.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/ccpanels-300x200.jpg)](https://www.vericormed.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/ccpanels.jpg)
#### A Question from Your Colleagues
**Question:** Do I need to use all six panels?  
  
**Answer:** No. For instance, lab-validated results show the VT-08 will hold a 2-8°C range for 76+ hours when using all six panels. That same unit packed-out using only one panel (on the bottom) will last 22 hours…still longer than the typical use time. So if needed less than a day, try using only one panel in the Cool Cube™. Its capacity increases by 65% (to hold more product) while its weight decreases by 54% (lighter to carry). Watch just how simple the Cool Cube™ system is in this short [2-minute video (click here).](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9G9pjNjopU&feature=youtu.be)
