VeriCor systems are easily managed and sustained by our customers. However, at times personnel and resources are scarce and it’s just easier to let the professionals do it. Our Medical Supply Replenishment packages let our customers focus on their other duties rather than preparedness system maintenance. From basic package-and-send services to on-site replacement solutions, VeriCor’s supply replenishment will ensure that your valuable Response-Friendly® System is up-to-date, organized, and ready to respond.
Take a look at the information below, but if you are remotely interested in this service be sure to call (608) 526-6901 and ask for a Replenishment Service Specialist. Or send an email to info@vericormed.com with your contact information and they will be sure to get back to you.
