### January is not too early to begin your annual flu clinic planning.
## **Late-January**
  * Review immunization laws, regulations, recommendations and standards.
  * Review what was done in your community in the past.
  * Identify under-served populations and determine target populations.
  * Make contact with (and research clinic locations convenient to) target populations.
  * Reserve key space such as a senior center or city hall.
  * Begin to recruit volunteers.

**February**
  * Review the vaccine ordering process.

During the planning process, keep in mind that proper equipment can simplify the process and prevent cold chain incidences:  
Three of VeriCor’s product lines will help simplify the entire vaccination process and prevent cold chain incidences:
  1. **Vaccine Transporters** – Specialized coolers that don’t use gel packs, ice packs, or electricity, yet hold required temperatures for 60+ hours. Certified thermometers available.

  2. **Vaccination Kits** – Complete, organized systems of vaccination supplies; just add staff and vaccine. It’s as easy as: store, transport, setup.

  3. **Nursing Workstations** – Rolling workstations with integrated table, drawers, bins, and an under-the-counter refrigerator (no freezer).
