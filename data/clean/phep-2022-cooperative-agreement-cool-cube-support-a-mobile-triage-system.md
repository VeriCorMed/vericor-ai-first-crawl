### A) PHEP 2022 Cooperative Agreement
`  
 `
#### Budget Period 4 (BP4)
The Public Health Emergency Preparedness (PHEP) cooperative agreement is a critical funding source for the state, local, and territorial public health departments. Preparedness activities funded by the PHEP cooperative agreement specifically target the development of emergency-ready public health departments that are flexible and adaptable.

### A) Cool Cube™ Support
#### 23 videos, PDFs galore, and just a phone call away!
When a new product arrives, the hope is that it’s easy and intuitive (like Cool Cube™ PCM Coolers). However, sometimes just a bit of support—whether for training, questions, or troubleshooting—is desired. That’s why the VeriCor website is extensive. From [overviews](https://www.vericormed.com/protect/) to how-to [videos](https://www.youtube.com/user/VeriCorMed/videos) to spec sheets to [user guides](https://www.vericormed.com/cc-support/), find support when you need it. If not, we are just a phone call away: 608-526-6901.

### B) A Mobile Triage System?
#### Yes—plus treatment capabilities! 
Mass casualty incidences (MCIs) can overwhelm and disrupt a healthcare network if a plan isn’t in place to expand patient treatment outside traditional walls. VeriCor’s all-in-one Hospital Triage and Treatment System is an intuitive, color-coordinated, mobile system of supplies that provides secondary triage and definitive treatment for a surge of 100 patients. Managers like it because it’s easy to maintain, and responders like it because it can deploy anywhere. See the system in action ([YouTube video here](https://youtu.be/Xo_hfT2JOaY)) and then click the picture/button to learn more, or call 608-526-6901 to speak with an experienced VeriCor staff member today.

### C) Got a mess?
#### Turn it into a Response-Friendly® System!
Sometimes emergency preparedness supplies are forgotten or not given attention until it is too late. Expired, unorganized, damaged, and recalled assets will hinder a response, and that’s where we can help. Our Medical Cache Conversion process converts a mess of supplies into an organized and manageable ready-to-respond system. Then when a mass causality incident (MCI) happens, you can respond with a Response-Friendly® system.
