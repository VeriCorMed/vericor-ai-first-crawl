### A) Flashback to 10/8/19
#### Before COVID-19…
13 months ago (10/8/19) we emailed/posted this short blurb:
> 500 million people infected! Can you name it?  
>  The world looks very different than it did 101 years ago when that happened. For one thing, there are much better cold chain management tools (that’s our small contribution). If interested in this topic, the World Health Organization has a page you should check out…  
>  [Influenza: are we ready? ](https://www.who.int/news-room/spotlight/influenza-are-we-ready)
That article really is a good read in light of the unprecedented times we are in now.

### A) A Premier Qualified Container & Packout
#### For vaccine, medicine, blood products, FFP and more.
Cool Cube™ PCM coolers come in four sizes:
            * The “03” is ideal for small payloads.
            * The “08” holds just enough to still carry over-the-shoulder.
            * The “28” wheels around for larger initiatives.
            * The “96” fits a whole freezer/fridge worth of vaccine (literally).

All have the same PCM system (for safe temperatures) and insulation system (for long hold times).
If you haven’t already, watch this 113-second explainer video to see the simplicity and effectiveness of Cool Cube™ PCM Coolers.

### B) Hospital Triage & Treatment System
#### A quick setup in times of crisis.
Mass casualty incidences (MCIs) can overwhelm and disrupt a healthcare network if a system is not available to expand patient treatment outside of traditional walls. VeriCor’s all-in-one Hospital Triage and Treatment System is an intuitive, color-coordinated, mobile system of supplies that provides secondary triage and definitive treatment for a surge of 100 patients. Managers like it because it’s easy to maintain. Responders like it because it can deploy anywhere with the right supplies in the right place quickly. See the system in action ([YouTube video here](https://youtu.be/Xo_hfT2JOaY)) and then call 608-526-6901 to speak with a specialist.
