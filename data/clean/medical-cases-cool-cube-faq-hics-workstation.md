### Cool Cube™ FAQ![Cold Chain Management has Evolved](https://www.vericormed.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Cold-Chain-Management-has-Evolved-300x200.jpg)
#### A Question From Your Colleagues
**Question:** “What kind of buffering material is suggested?”  
  
**Answer:** NONE! Sometimes habits get so ingrained that progress is stifled (case in point). As the story goes, in the old days ice bottles kept vaccine cool while traveling or administering off-site. But because the ice bottles were at 0°C/32°F, of course buffering material was needed (plus a little hope the vaccine wouldn’t get too cold). Nowadays, Cool Cube™ phase change materials (PCMs) have custom formulated temperatures (fridge, frozen, room) within the needed parameters. For instance, vaccine needing to stay between 2-8°C is put in a Cool Cube™ with panels that are at 4.5°C/40.1°F. Because no buffering material is needed, more space is available for pack-out and the SOP is simplified.
