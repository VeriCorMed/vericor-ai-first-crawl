_About**Refrigerator PCM** (Phase Change Material)_
PCM absorbs and releases thermal energy during the process of melting and freezing. When solid PCM melts, it absorbs the heat from the environment, yet its temperature stays at the melting point until totally liquid. Conversely, when liquid PCM freezes, it absorbs the cold from the environment yet stays at its temperature until totally solid. Therefore, PCM an ideal, passive solution for a variety of applications that require temperature control. The most common PCM is water, which has a melting point of 0 °C (32 °F). When solid, ice/water maintains a temperature of 0 °C until it turns completely liquid. So, in essence, the 0 °C melting point makes it unsafe for most refrigerator temperature sensitive applications.
Cool Cube™ **Refrigerator PCM** has a melting point of 4.5 °C/40.1 °F. When the PCM is solid, a panel helps the Cool Cube ™stay cool (about 5 °C) in warm/hot environments. When the PCM is liquid, a panel helps the Cool Cube ™stay warm (about 4 °C) in freezing conditions. It’s right around that 4.5 °C/40.1 °F where a PCM panel’s temperature plateaus for a while during the warming up and/or cooling down processes.

![Refrigerated Prep A - Freezer-Fridge Prep to keep product cold](https://www.vericormed.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Refrigerated-Prep-A-1.png)
#### Refrigerated 4 Prep Method A: Freezer to Fridge Pack-Out Instructions
**Panel Prep**
**2.1 Lay panels flat in a freezer** until all the PCM (phase change material inside the panel) turns solid. At -15°C/5°F the PCM will solidify in a couple hours.
**2.2 Transfer panels into a fridge** at least 3 hours before use. Panels may be stored in the fridge until needed for assembly or until the PCM melts.*
* If a fridge maintains 4°C/39°F or below, the PCM within the panels will not melt (melting point is 4.5°C/40°F), which will keep the panel solid indefinitely until pack-out. If the fridge maintains 5°C/41°F or above, periodically check for melting and restart at step 2.1 to ensure optimal performance.

![Shake PCM Panel To Check](https://www.vericormed.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Shake-PCM-Panel-To-Check-150x150.png)
**2.3 Shake panels to verify the PCM is solid.** If there is liquid, restart at step 2.1 to ensure the longest hold time. Using liquid PCM or panels with a solid/liquid combination decreases the hold time.

![Refrigerated Prep B - Fridge ONLY Prep to keep product cold](https://www.vericormed.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Refrigerated-Prep-B-1.png)
#### Refrigerated Prep Method B: Fridge Only Pack-Out Instructions
**Panel Prep**
**2.1 Lay panels flat in a refrigerator** for a minimum of 24 hours before use.
**2.2 Shake panels** to check the state of the PCM (phase change material inside the panel).
**![Shake PCM Panel To Check](https://www.vericormed.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Shake-PCM-Panel-To-Check-150x150.png)**
          * If liquid…panel is at the fridge temp but above 5°C; anticipate shorter hold times.

          * If solid…panel is at the fridge temp but below 4°C; ideal for maximum hold times.

  * If solid/liquid combination…panel is at the fridge temp of 4-5°C; monitor time/temp.

> In a refrigerator that maintains 4°C or below, the PCM will be solid (ideal for keeping product cold in warm/hot conditions). In a refrigerator that maintains 5°C or above, the PCM will be liquid. Although the PCM is liquid, the panel is at the temperature of the storage environment after 3 hours (i.e., stored in a 6°C fridge, the panels are at 6°C). Assembling the Cool Cube™ with liquid PCM panels (additional thermal mass) will help keep the product at its temperature, just for a shorter amount of time. Monitor Cool Cube™ temperature closely.

#### Refrigerated Prep Method C: Freezer to Room Pack-Out Instructions
**Panel Prep**
**2.1 Lay panels flat in a freezer** until all the PCM (phase change material inside the panel) turns solid. At -15°C/5°F the PCM will solidify in a couple hours.
**2.2 Transfer panels into a room temperature environment just before** use to allow the PCM inside to rise to the appropriate operating temperature. Approximate times:
          * “03” size = 25 minutes

          * “08” size = 30 minutes

          * “28” size = 35 minutes

          * “96” size = 40 minutes

**Times based on a 22°C/72°F room.

#### Series 4 Prep Method D: Fridge Only Pack-Out Instructions (to prevent freezing)
**Panel Prep**
**2.1 Place panels in a fridge between 5° and 8°C** for at least 24 hours before use so the PCM (phase change material inside the panel) is liquid.*
* Panels may be stored in the fridge until needed for assembly or the PCM solidifies. If a refrigerator maintains 5°C or above, the PCM within the panels will not get solid (the solidifying point is 4.5°C), keeping the PCM liquid indefinitely until pack-out. Liquid PCM panels will protect the product from freezing until the PCM becomes completely solid.

![Shake PCM Panel To Check](https://www.vericormed.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Shake-PCM-Panel-To-Check-150x150.png)
**2.2 Shake panels to verify the PCM is liquid.** If solid, restart at step 2.1 to ensure the longest hold time. Liquid PCM will prevent the product from freezing (at refrigerator temps) in extreme cold the longest. Using solid PCM or panels with a solid/liquid combination decreases the hold time.

**2.3 Wipe off condensate & shake.**After frost turns to condensate, the panel is above 0°C. Shake panels to verify that the PCM is completely solid. If liquid is heard, re-freeze (Step 2.1) and proceed. Using liquid PCM decreases the hold time considerably.
![asterisk 3](https://www.vericormed.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/asterisk-3.png)
**After Step 3 (before pack-out), insert a thermometer** and close to monitor when the Cool Cube™ gets to the 1°C mark. If below the 1°C mark, wait until it warms up to 1°C before packing out. To speed up the process, transfer panels into a room temperature environment for a couple of minutes and re-check. Pack-out at 1°C will ensure a maximum hold time between 1° and 6°C.

#### [Refrigerator PCM Temps Info](https://www.vericormed.com/product/fridge-temps-pcm-panel-for-cool-cube-08-large/#1545831077972-f7f94196-c03cb359-a4e09adc-2871)
![Thermal Properties of Series 4 PCM Panels](https://www.vericormed.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Refrigerated-Temps-PCM-Shake-Test.png)
Phase change materials (PCMs) are materials that absorb and release thermal energy during the process of melting and freezing. When a PCM melts, it absorbs the heat from the environment, yet its temperature stays at the melting point until totally liquid. Conversely, when a PCM freezes, it absorbs the cold from the environment, yet stays at its temperature until totally solid. This makes PCM an ideal, passive solution for a variety of applications that require temperature control. The most common PCM is water/ice. Ice is an excellent PCM for maintaining temperatures at 0°C. But water’s freezing point is fixed at 0°C (32°F), which makes it unsuitable for most temperature sensitive applications.
Cool Cube™ PCMs offer custom temperature holds based on their melting point. The PCM inside Series 4 panels has a melting point of 4.5°C/40.1°F. When panels are solid, contents within the Cool Cube™ stay cool (at fridge temps around 4.5°C) in hot conditions during an extended period of time. When panels have liquid inside, contents within the Cool Cube™ won’t freeze (again at fridge temps around 4.5°C) in extreme cold during an extended period of time.
When the panels have reached 4.5°C and are completely solid, they are ready to hold your product. To verify that they are solid simply shake the panel. If you shake the panel and it feels and sounds slushy, with some liquid and some solid it will hold your product at a cool temperature, but it won’t hold it as long as if the panel is completely solid. If you shake the panel and it feels and sounds completely liquid, put the panel back into the freezer/refrigerator and continue to condition until the panel has reached a solid state.
Shake a panel at various times to get to know your panels. For example, shake the panels when you know they are warm to hear and feel how they react when they are liquid. 
Within this webpage are several methods for conditioning your PCM panels. The standard conditioning method is performed in the refrigerator. The advantage of the refrigerator is that your panels won’t get too cold. This method can take from 8-24 hours. Alternatively, if you need to use your panels sooner than 8-24 hours, they can be conditioned in a freezer.
PCM panels can be frozen too cold, but there is an easy solution when this occurs. When the panels are frozen to a point below 0°C/32°F, a short staging period is necessary to safely transport your product. If your panels have been stored in the freezer simply take the panels out of the freezer and lay them, individually (unstacked), on a flat surface at room temperature for roughly 30 minutes.
Hold times of the PCM panels vary depending on Cool Cube™ size and desired holding temperature. For example, when properly packed-out into the Cool Cube™ 08, the Series 4 PCM panels can hold the cooler at a temperature below 8°C and above 2°C for 76 hours.
With all pack-out procedures, be sure to use a temperature monitoring device to consistently and accurately monitor the temperature your payload for the entire time it is held in the Cool Cube™. Some regulatory bodies such as the CDC require the use of a certified data logger. VeriCor carries several types of thermometers and digital data loggers that meet the CDC recommended guidelines.

    * Always prep the PCM panels before use according to one of the described methods provided by VeriCor.

    * Ensure all components are clean and free of damage.

    * During prep, enable ample air flow around all panel sides (use spacers or racks).

    * Lay panels flat when “freezing”.

    * Freeze/melting times vary depending on number of panels being prepped and equipment specifications being used. Assemble using all six panels for maximum hold time.

    * Using less panels does not change the holding temperature but does decrease hold time.

    * Panels are reusable (10,000+ cycles). (End-of-life disposal: panels use a plastic #2, typically recycled by businesses/communities; PCM is nontoxic and readily biodegradable.)

    * Use a calibrated data logger or other temperature monitoring device to observe internal temperature.

    * Avoid unnecessary opening of the Cool Cube™ after loading payload. Opening of the Cool Cube™ will decrease hold time.

    * An infrared temperature thermometer can assist in ensuring the panels reach a safe pack-out temperature (good for finding out the approximate temperature of each panel).

  * Further the temps are away from the melting point, the quicker PCM will change states.

#### **VT-08 Specific FAQ**
[ l How long will the “VT-08” Cool Cube™ last?  ](https://www.vericormed.com/product/fridge-temps-pcm-panel-for-cool-cube-08-large/)
When properly conditioned, the VT-08 will hold temperatures between **2°C and 8°C** for at least **76+ hours**.
[ l How do I condition the “VT-08” for use?  ](https://www.vericormed.com/product/fridge-temps-pcm-panel-for-cool-cube-08-large/)
  1. Place panels in a freezer until all PCM turns solid (i.e. 2 hrs. @ -15°C). Shake to verify.
  2. Transfer panels into a fridge at least 3 hours before use. Panels may be stored in the fridge until needed for assembly or the PCM melts.*
  3. Before assembly, shake panels to verify PCM is solid. If liquid is heard, restart at step 2a to ensure longest hold time. Using liquid panels, or panels with a solid/liquid combination, decreases hold time.

_*If a refrigerator maintains 4°C or below, the PCM within the panels will not melt (melting point is 4.5°C), which will keep the panel solid indefinitely until pack-out. If the refrigerator maintains 5°C or above, periodically check for melting and restart at step 2a to ensure best performance._

[ l What is a PCM panel?  ](https://www.vericormed.com/product/fridge-temps-pcm-panel-for-cool-cube-08-large/)
A **PCM panel** in the Cool Cube is a key component that uses **Phase Change Material (PCM)** to help regulate the temperature inside the unit. These panels are designed to maintain specific temperature ranges crucial for protecting temperature-sensitive items like vaccines, medicines, and biological samples.
Each PCM panel contains a material that melts and solidifies at precise temperatures. As the surrounding temperature increases, the PCM inside the panel absorbs the heat and melts, stabilizing the environment. When the temperature decreases, the PCM solidifies and releases the stored heat, preventing the interior from cooling too rapidly.
In the Cool Cube, there are different types of PCM panels, each indicated by a color-coded tab, designed to maintain different temperature ranges: 
  * **Refrigerator PCM Panels (Blue Tab)** : 2°C to 8°C.
  * **Lab Freezer PCM Panels (Gray Tab)** : -50°C to -15°C.
  * **Room Temperature PCM Panels (Tan Tab)** : 15°C to 25° 

Each Cool Cube comes with 6 PCM panels that make up the PCM System.
[ l What is a VIP System?  ](https://www.vericormed.com/product/fridge-temps-pcm-panel-for-cool-cube-08-large/)
**Answer:**
The **VIP System** , or **Vacuum Insulated Panel System** , is a cutting-edge insulation technology used in Cool Cube products to provide superior thermal protection. VIPs are constructed with a core material surrounded by a vacuum-sealed barrier. This combination offers exceptional insulation, far more efficient than traditional materials like foam or polyurethane. Here’s how it works:
#### 1. Vacuum Insulation:
The vacuum inside the panels minimizes heat transfer by significantly reducing conduction and convection, which are the primary ways heat is transferred. This vacuum environment is key to achieving the high thermal resistance, or R-value, that makes VIPs so effective at keeping heat out and cold in (or vice versa).
#### 2. Efficiency:
VIPs can be up to five times more effective than conventional insulation, meaning they can maintain stable internal temperatures for much longer periods. This is particularly crucial in applications where temperature-sensitive products like vaccines, medicines, or biological samples are being stored or transported.
#### 3. Durability:
VIPs are built to last. The protective outer wrapping around the core helps ensure that the vacuum remains intact, maintaining the panel’s high insulation performance for years. Even after five years, VIPs can retain up to 95% of their original insulating power.
#### 4. Application in Cool Cubes:
In Cool Cubes, the VIP System works in tandem with PCM (Phase Change Material) panels to maintain precise temperature control for long durations, even in extreme conditions. The VIP System is housed within the outer case of the Cool Cube, ensuring that internal temperatures remain stable without relying on electricity or ice.
By utilizing VIP technology, Cool Cubes offer reliable, energy-efficient temperature control for critical applications like medical transport, off-site vaccination efforts, and emergency preparedness.
[ l What is PCM?  ](https://www.vericormed.com/product/fridge-temps-pcm-panel-for-cool-cube-08-large/)
PCM, or **Phase Change Material** , is a type of substance that can store and release large amounts of thermal energy as it changes from one state of matter to another, specifically between solid and liquid phases. This ability to absorb and release heat during its phase transitions makes PCM useful for controlling temperatures.
Here’s how it works: When a material melts (changes from a solid to a liquid), it absorbs heat from its surroundings, which cools down the environment around it. When the material freezes (changes from liquid back to solid), it releases the heat it had absorbed, warming up the environment.
What makes PCM special is that it is engineered to melt and freeze at very specific temperatures, depending on its formulation. For example, some PCM might be designed to melt at a relatively low temperature, like 5°C, while others might melt at higher temperatures. This allows PCM to be used for different applications, like keeping things cool or warm without the need for constant external energy, such as refrigeration.
Because PCM changes phases so efficiently, it can absorb or release a lot of heat without changing its own temperature much during the process. This makes it an excellent tool for maintaining stable temperatures over time, which is critical for safely transporting temperature-sensitive products like vaccines, medicines, and biological samples.
[ l What is a VIP Panel?  ](https://www.vericormed.com/product/fridge-temps-pcm-panel-for-cool-cube-08-large/)
Vacuum Insulation Panel – a form of thermal insulation consisting of a gas-tight enclosure surrounding a rigid core, from which the air has been evacuated.
[ l How does PCM improve cooling efficiency?  ](https://www.vericormed.com/product/fridge-temps-pcm-panel-for-cool-cube-08-large/)
**Answer:**
PCM (Phase Change Material) improves cooling efficiency by leveraging its ability to store and release large amounts of thermal energy during its phase transitions (melting and freezing). Unlike conventional cooling methods, PCM absorbs heat as it changes from solid to liquid, maintaining a stable temperature for longer periods without active refrigeration. When the temperature around the PCM drops, it re-solidifies, releasing the stored energy and continuing to regulate the temperature.
In the Cool Cube product line, PCM helps improve cooling efficiency in the following ways:
  * **Temperature Stability:** PCM maintains a precise, consistent temperature over time, reducing fluctuations that could compromise sensitive materials like vaccines or lab samples.
  * **Energy Efficiency:** By absorbing and releasing thermal energy, PCM minimizes the need for constant refrigeration or energy input, especially during transport, leading to lower energy consumption.
  * **Extended Cooling Duration:** PCM can maintain the desired temperature for a prolonged period, making it ideal for passive cooling solutions during transport or power outages, which improves overall cooling reliability.
  * **Freeze Protection:** PCM prevents the freezing of materials that should remain at above-freezing temperatures, avoiding the risk of damage due to ice or extreme cold.

By using PCM, Cool Cube products ensure that temperature-sensitive materials remain within safe temperature ranges with fewer external cooling interventions, thus increasing the overall efficiency and reliability of the system.
[ l What makes PCM superior to ice?  ](https://www.vericormed.com/product/fridge-temps-pcm-panel-for-cool-cube-08-large/)
**Answer:**
PCM (Phase Change Material) offers several advantages over traditional ice for temperature control, making it a superior choice in applications like the VeriCor Cool Cube. Here’s why:
  * **Precise Temperature Control:**  
Ice maintains a temperature around 0°C (32°F) as it melts, which can be too cold for many temperature-sensitive materials like vaccines and medicines. This can result in accidental freezing, which can ruin the products. PCM, on the other hand, is specifically formulated to maintain a precise temperature. For example: 
    * **Refrigerator PCM** holds temperatures between 2°C and 8°C.
    * **Lab Freezer PCM** holds temperatures around -20°C.
This targeted temperature control prevents freezing (in the case of refrigerator temps) or overheating (in the case of lab freezer temps), ensuring the materials stay within their required temperature range. 
  * **Longer Duration of Stable Temperatures:**  
PCM can maintain a consistent temperature for a longer period than ice. As ice melts, it quickly loses its cooling effectiveness. In contrast, PCM absorbs and releases heat more gradually during its phase change, keeping temperatures stable for extended periods. This makes PCM ideal for transporting materials over long distances or storing them during power outages. 
  * **Energy Efficiency:**  
PCM reduces the need for active refrigeration or the constant replacement of ice packs. It provides a passive, energy-efficient cooling solution. This not only saves energy but also reduces the hassle of constantly replenishing ice, particularly during transport. 
  * **No Risk of Water Damage:**  
When ice melts, it turns into water, which can damage packaging or create messes in storage units. PCM, however, remains self-contained within sealed containers as it changes phases, so there’s no risk of leaks or water damage. This ensures a cleaner, safer environment for sensitive materials. 
  * **Customized Temperature Ranges:**  
PCM can be tailored to specific temperature ranges based on the needs of the products being stored. Ice cannot be customized to maintain temperatures other than around 0°C, making it less versatile. PCM can be used in Cool Cubes for refrigeration, freezing, or even room temperature control, depending on the type of PCM selected. 
  * **Lightweight and Portable:**  
PCM is lighter than carrying large quantities of ice, making Cool Cubes easier to transport. Since PCM is engineered for efficiency, you need less of it compared to the amount of ice you would need for the same cooling effect, which enhances portability.
