### A) Pro Tips From Users Like You
#### Tips to get the most out of your Cool Cube™.
  1. **Use only one PCM panel.**
The temperature of a Cool Cube™ is determined by the type of phase change material (PCM) used, not the quantity. The quantity of panels determines the time it will last: the more panels = longer hold time; less panels = shorter hold time. If needing only a few hours of protection, one panel will maintain the temperature just fine for a short time. The benefits: lighter and more pack-out space available. (To get the full, qualified pack out time of 65+ hours, use all six panels.) 
  2. **Use tongue depressors to stack panels during storage.**
Sometimes storage space is limited. Stack PCM panels on top of each other with two tongue depressors (or pencils) in between each layer. This allows air flow around each panel, which will lead to a quicker, more even prep of each panel. 
  3. **Use a compact luggage cart to wheel around more than one Cool Cube™ at a time.**
A $30 dolly enables one person to wheel around multiple, smaller-sized units such as the [VT-03](https://www.vericormed.com/product/cool-cube-03-at-fridge-temperatures-vt-03-vaccine-transport-cooler/) and [VT-08](https://www.vericormed.com/product/cooler-cool-cube-08-vaccine-transport-cooler-at-refrigerated-temperatures-fresh-vaccine-vt-08/). However, you don’t need anything for the two larger Cool Cube™ PCM coolers (the [VT-28](https://www.vericormed.com/product/cooler-cool-cube-28-vaccine-transport-cooler-at-refrigerated-temperatures-fresh-vaccine-vt-28/) and [VT-96](https://www.vericormed.com/product/cool-cube-96-vaccine-transport-cooler-at-refrigerated-temperatures-for-fresh-vaccine-vt-96/)) as they have integrated wheels. 
  4. **Don’t use any panels.**
The insulation of the Cool Cube™ is so advanced that sometimes you may not need the PCM panels. The inside of the cooler quickly acclimates to the large mass of conditioned product. Then the Temp-Shield™ insulation does a great job at keeping ambient temperatures at bay. 
  5. **Quickly solidify the Series 4 PCM in an ultra-low freezer.**
Let’s say that you need your Cool Cube™ later in the day, but the PCM panels are sitting in your office, not prepped properly. No problem…they can be ready to use in approximately 90 minutes: put the panels in a -25°C freezer for an hour, and then let them sit out 25 minutes prior to use. It’s a quick way to get the Cool Cube™ ready.

#### Finally organize those preparedness supplies.
When responding personnel go into the field, it is essential that medical supplies are safe, intact and ready to treat patients. Secure, mobilize, organize, and protect valuable medical equipment and supplies during storage and through deployment. From the compact Upright Medical Organizer ([MC-UMO](https://www.vericormed.com/product/upright-medical-organizer-mc-umo-medical-roll-pack/)) to the rolling Mobile Charging Station ([MC-MCS](https://www.vericormed.com/product/mobile-charging-station-mc-mcs/)), checkout VeriCor’s wide array of options.
