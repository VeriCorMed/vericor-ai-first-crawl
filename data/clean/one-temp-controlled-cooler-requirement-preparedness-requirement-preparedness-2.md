### Two Simple Questions![One Temp Controlled Cooler](https://www.vericormed.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/One-Temp-Controlled-Cooler-300x200.jpg)
#### One Temp Controlled Cooler
  1. What temperature range is needed?
  2. How much interior space is needed?

Answering these two questions will direct you to a cooler and pack-out system that will surprise you and have someone saying “why didn’t we buy these last year?” Qualified/validated Cool Cubes™ are safe, easy to use, and hold valuable product at a consistent refrigerated, frozen or room temperature for days.

### Replacing Expired Supplies![A Requirement of Preparedness](https://www.vericormed.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/A-Requirement-of-Preparedness-300x200.jpg)
#### A Requirement of Preparedness
Supply management (a.k.a. inventory control) of earmarked preparedness product can be daunting. But don’t let it slide. Right now, do a quick check and make sure supplies are up-to-date (because the last thing anyone wants is an audit or deployment of expired product). If you have a Response-Friendly® System, use the SmartBook™ inventory file and sort by “Expiration Date” to make sure that first date is somewhere down the road. Don’t have time? Find out more about VeriCor’s replenishment services.

### Organizing to Respond![Convert a Cache into a System](https://www.vericormed.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Convert-a-Cache-into-a-System-300x200.jpg)
#### A Requirement of Preparedness #2
Do boxes of product sit in storage waiting for an incident? If something happened tomorrow, can specific supplies be located and dispersed by the staff quickly? Are all items safe to use for patient treatment by responders? With hard work and attention to detail, VeriCor’s Medical Cache Conversion process converts a mess of supplies into a ready-to-respond system that is organized and manageable.
