#### Large Capacity Temp Assurance
The [newly released](https://www.vericormed.com/?wpfb_dl=569) Cool Cube™ 96 is the ideal solution to move or store (back-up scenarios) large quantities of temperature sensitive product. Like other Cool Cubes™ it has a user-friendly case for easy mobility and a Temp-Shield™ insulation system for a long-lasting temperature hold. Integrated/interchangeable PCM panels enable safe, dependable temperature configurations for refrigerated, frozen and/or controlled room temperature product. And with its enormous capacity (96 liters or 18″ x 18″ x 18″ of usable space) it is sure to be worth every penny after just one use. (But don’t worry, these last for years and years with little to no maintenance.)

### Response-Ready PPE Kits[![Infectious Disease Prep Ready to use EVD PPE Kits](https://www.vericormed.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Infectious-Disease-Prep-Ready-to-use-EVD-PPE-Kits-300x200.jpg)](https://www.vericormed.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Infectious-Disease-Prep-Ready-to-use-EVD-PPE-Kits.jpg)
#### Infectious Disease Prevention
Infectious disease incidents pose unique challenges that diminish a healthcare’s response to an emergency. So having ready prepositioned PPE kits to control the spread of disease and enable the continuity of health care services should save lives. VeriCor’s smaller, prepackaged modules ([12](https://www.vericormed.com/product/ebola-ppe-12-kits-ss-evd12/) and [25](https://www.vericormed.com/product/ebola-ppe-25-kits-ss-evd25/) single-use kits) are organized within a mobile storage case for quick deployment. The [100-patient contact module](https://www.vericormed.com/product/ebola-ppe-100-ss-evd100/) integrates all PPE into four mobile cases, and includes an inventory management SmartBook™ for easy rotation and handling. Customization options are available.
