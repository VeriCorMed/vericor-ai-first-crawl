### Cool Cube™ Insulation[![say no to frozen bottles Cool Cube™ Insulation](https://www.vericormed.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/cc2-1-300x200.jpg)](https://www.vericormed.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/cc2-1.jpg)
#### VIPs are a Very Important Part
Some coolers are bulky & heavy. Others cannot hold a temperature for more than one hour. Cool Cube™ PCM coolers solve both problems. At just 1″ thick, the vacuum insulation panels (VIPs) of a Cool Cube™ insulate better than 3.3″ of polyurethane — the insulation found in other “high-performance” coolers. This unique feature (one of many) ensures that temperature sensitive product is at the right temperature for days. That means days to solve an electrical outage problem. That means days of transporting to a far off location. That means days of off-site use without having to mess with ice or electricity. That means days of temperature assurance!
