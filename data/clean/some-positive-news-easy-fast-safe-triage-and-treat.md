### A) Three Words
#### Easy — Fast — Safe.
  1. Easy – Patented panels simplify pack-out.
  2. Fast – No layers or buffering material to mess around with.
  3. Safe – Does not utilize traditional ice (which drops the temperature too low).

If you haven’t already, watch this [113-second explainer video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9G9pjNjopU&feature=youtu.be) to see the simplicity and effectiveness of Cool Cube™ PCM Coolers.

### B) Triage AND Treat a Surge of Patients
#### Deploy anywhere!
Mass casualty incidences (MCIs) can overwhelm and disrupt a healthcare network if a system is unavailable to expand patient treatment outside traditional walls. VeriCor’s all-in-one Hospital Triage and Treatment System is an intuitive, color-coordinated, mobile system of supplies that provides secondary triage and definitive treatment for a surge of 100 patients. Managers like it because it’s easy to maintain. Responders like it because it can deploy anywhere with the right supplies in the right place quickly. See the system in action ([YouTube video here](https://youtu.be/Xo_hfT2JOaY)) and then call 608-526-6901 to speak with a specialist.
