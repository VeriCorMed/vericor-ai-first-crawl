3mL luer lock safety syringes with a detachable needle help keep clinicians safe while providing maximum clinical flexibility.

* SAFETY SHIELD: Locking mechanism protects the clinician and end user from accidental needlestick injury.
* TRANSPORT POSITION: Allows clinician to safely transport medication and eliminates the need to recap the needle.
* SILICONE LUBRICATION: We add a layer of microbonded lubrication to help the needle glide into the skin.
* MICRO POLISHED: Each needle is polished to a smooth finish, removing any very small blemishes that could occur during the manufacturing process and cause painful skin tearing.
* ACCURATE DOSING: Bold dose unit markings and large barrel flanges for accurate dosing and easy grip and control.
