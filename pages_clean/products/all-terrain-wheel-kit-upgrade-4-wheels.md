# All-Terrain Wheel Upgrade (4 Wheels)

**Summary:** A set of wheels making it easier to move a VeriCor case over many different terrains. These lower profile tires, with low rolling resistance, have a vastly wider load dispersion over soft terrain compared to standard wheels.

[vc\_row][vc\_column][vc\_column\_text]The All-Terrain Wheel Upgrade (UP-ATWK) is a set of wheels installed during assembly (replacing the standard wheels) that make it easier to move a VeriCor case over many different terrains. These lower profile tires, with low rolling resistance, have a vastly wider load dispersion over soft terrain compared to standard wheels. Four wheels and mounting (when purchased with a case) included. (\*\*\*This upgrade can only be purchased in conjunction with a case. This is not a stand-alone item for a retrofit.)[/vc\_column\_text][/vc\_column][/vc\_row][vc\_row full\_width="stretch\_row\_content\_no\_spaces"][vc\_column][vc\_separator border\_width="2"][/vc\_column][/vc\_row][vc\_row][vc\_column][vc\_single\_image image="7461" img\_size="full"][/vc\_column][/vc\_row]
