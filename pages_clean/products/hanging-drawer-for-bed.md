# Hanging Drawer for Bed

**Summary:** A hanging pocket for holding small items on response beds. This small accessory is made of the same anti-microbial vinyl used on mattress covers to ensure that it is safe and easy to clean.

[vc\_row][vc\_column][vc\_column\_text]The Hanging Drawer for Bed (RB-HD) is a handy pocket for response beds. Attached to the front leg brace of a bed, this accessory is made from the same anti-microbial vinyl that is used in the mattress covers to ensure that it is safe and easy to clean. One large pocket is ideal for a clipboard or other similarly sized objects. One small pocket can be used for a triage flip flag or other small items. Velcro is used for attaching, so additional drawers may be placed on other parts of the bed frame as needed.[/vc\_column\_text][/vc\_column][/vc\_row][vc\_row full\_width="stretch\_row\_content\_no\_spaces"][vc\_column][vc\_separator border\_width="2"][/vc\_column][/vc\_row][vc\_row full\_width="stretch\_row" content\_placement="middle" css=".vc\_custom\_1538504489259{background-image: url(https://www.vericormed.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Dimensions-Background.png?id=6494) !important;background-position: center !important;background-repeat: no-repeat !important;background-size: cover !important;}"][vc\_column][vc\_column\_text]
